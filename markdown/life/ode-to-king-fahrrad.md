The word *“Fahrrad”* reminds me of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. But no, it’s not about that. *Ein Fahrrad* just means “a bicycle.” And this long-overdue blog post is about my bicycle and what it’s like to use it around town. Whoa. Calm down. You’re too excited.

Last fall, I bought a used bicycle for €170 from [B7 Cycling Center](https://goo.gl/maps/ijv5ky1szcRvYkSu5), a shop that hires former inmates and trains them as mechanics. The brand name on my bike’s frame says *“Heavy Tool.”* Literal translations are hilarious, aren’t they?

My friend Florian—one of a trillion Florians—taught me an alternative name for *Fahrrad*. The word is *“Drahtesel,”* which translates to “wire donkey.” That’s good stuff.

Here’s my donkey:

It’s not fancy, just a little commuter bike. But it does have a few tricks up its sleeve. The front light is powered by kinetic energy—a common feature in Europe, but something that disappeared in America decades ago.

It also has a tail light connected to the same circuit. I’m looking forward to using it again in the fall. During summer, there’s no need since the sun doesn’t set until around 9:00 PM.

## Commuting on My Fahrrad

I commute on my *Fahrrad* a few times a week. It’s only a 15-minute ride, and the route is flat and streamlined for bicycles.

Austria takes bicycles seriously. Kids under 12 must pass a test to ride on the street—it’s like a driver’s license for bikes. Drunk biking is also taken seriously: if you’re caught, you lose your right to drive a car.

Bicycles aren’t allowed on sidewalks unless the sidewalk is marked for it. While I haven’t seen the *Polizei* enforce this rule, I’ve heard stories. Many sidewalks are split, with pedestrians on the right and bikes on the left.

Bicycles even get their own traffic lights. Here’s a sidewalk light with a walking figure and a bike icon side by side:

Even crosswalk buttons have little bicycle icons on them:

And here’s a common sign marking a split sidewalk, along with lane indicators painted on the ground:

## Biking Culture in Austria

Most stores have bike racks, and they’re heavily used. You see older folks biking around far more often than in America. Here’s a guy who looks like he’s in his 70s, loading groceries onto his trusty steed. *Er braucht nicht auto—verstehst?*

![Bikes at the store](/images/matt/1_3t3ZyRcXQpnY7rwNOLAXiA.jpeg)

At my office, there’s a bike rack outside the building. Most people lock their bikes, but a few don’t. It’s surprisingly trusting. I’ve never heard of a stolen bike here, although leaving one unlocked in the city center is riskier.

Our office building has six floors. The elevator signs show that the garage includes a bike room. It’s still funny to me that the first floor is called “zero,” and the basement is “minus one.”

The bike room is accessed with a key card.

If you visit the *minus one* basement parking garage, you’ll see it’s nicely marked and color-coded: yellow for bikes, blue for cars.

Here’s the inside of the bike room. Spacious! Before COVID-19, it was tough to find a spot. Now it’s practically empty.

## Thoughts on Bicycles and King Fahd

So now you know all about bicycles—first-class Austrian transportation. It’s funny that the word *“Fahrrad”* reminds me of King Fahd, since Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest oil producer. Bikes are a solution to our oil addiction—something King Fahd probably wouldn’t have appreciated. Maybe my subconscious enjoys the irony.
