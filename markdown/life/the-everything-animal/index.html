        <div class="mb-5">
            <p>We’re ahead of ourselves. We want it to be April 2020, not September 2019. By April, the kids will take the tram on their own. They’ll have strong friendships. Alison and I will understand the healthcare system and know enough German to order a sandwich without having to point.</p>

<p>But it’s still September. We have to wait for the sun and moon to come and go 150 times.</p>

<p>I wish there were a magical way to fast-forward. Like in <em>The Matrix</em>, when Trinity calls back to the ship and says, “I need a program for a V-212 helicopter… Hurry!” Her eyelids flicker, and—presto—she instantly knows how to fly the helicopter.</p>

<p>Or like in movies. Screenwriters never waste time on the learning part. Kung Fu Panda becomes a martial arts master in five minutes. It’s the same with Marvel movies. Christian Bale (<em>Batman Begins</em>), Benedict Cumberbatch (<em>Doctor Strange</em>), Robert Downey Jr. (<em>Iron Man</em>)—they all figure out their new superpowers faster than it takes me to grab a bucket of popcorn and Milk Duds.</p>

<p>Today at work, the cleaning lady (she’s Croatian and doesn’t speak German well) asked if we had dirty dishes. She said “schmutzig” (dirty), which is like the Yiddish word “shmutz.” I wasn’t sure what she meant, so I asked someone to interpret. One of my coworkers wrote it on a whiteboard [2]. Then someone else added the word for “squirrel tail,” a word I’d heard before in a lunch conversation. It’s a popular Austrian word used to test if someone speaks Austrian German. People from Munich don’t even know what it means. I added a few more words I learned today—like “train” and “railway” from the train station, and “wheat beer” from a bar.</p>

<p>The final word on the whiteboard was a long one that loosely translates to “anything animal.” It’s called a <em>Wunder Wuzzi</em> in Austrian German, though that doesn’t actually mean “anything” or “animal.” A <em>Wunder Wuzzi</em> is an animal that does everything: it gives milk, grows wool, lays eggs, and tastes like bacon. The German word for this mythical beast is <em>Eierlegende Wollmilchsau</em> (“egg-laying wool milk pig”) [3]. Like “squirrel tail,” it’s mostly useless vocabulary—except for a good laugh.</p>

<p>The “everything animal” even came up later in a slide presentation. It’s a common saying here: there is no everything animal. In English, we’d say, “There’s no silver bullet.” No easy solutions. No shortcuts. We have to go through the learning phase—the hard stuff.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Not to be a downer, but this is one of the things I dislike about superhero movies. The learning part is the most interesting to me, even if I sometimes feel too lazy to pursue it myself. I dislike plenty of other things about superhero movies—or should I say <em>movie</em>, since most are just variations of the same story.</p></li>

<li><p>This week’s words für Matt:</p></li>
