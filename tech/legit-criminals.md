There was this attack early Tuesday morning in Paris. Three guys in black masks jumped from a white van, pepper-sprayed a family, and tried to drag a woman into their truck. Her crime? Her dad runs a crypto exchange. That [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/538/) about hitting someone with a $5 wrench until they give up their password? Not so funny anymore.

I've always been skeptical of crypto. Same way I approach any technology promising to "change everything." I went to one of the most privileged private schools in Boston, in a country where that already puts you near the top globally. But I hung out with the scholarship kids from rough neighborhoods who were there to make the school look diverse or play sports. Watching how the powerful create narratives for everyone else to follow, for their own benefit, taught me to be suspicious when everyone agrees something will "revolutionize" everything.

My friend [Rishi Dean](https://rishidean.com/2025/04/19/tough-love-letter-to-the-crypto-industry/), who was my PM mentor at Visible Measures during my first product role, went on to Google Ventures and then Coinbase before eventually leaving crypto to work with my sister at Lyft, nailed it: "We mistook rhetoric for reality.

When crypto was underground, the violence stayed theoretical. Now that it's gone mainstream, with institutions buying in and [Trump hawking memecoins](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/25/trump-crypto-corruption-ethics), the kidnappings are very real. French crypto executive [David Balland had his finger severed](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kidnapped-co-founder-french-crypto-firm-ledger-had-his-hand-mutilated-2025-01-24/) by kidnappers. Influencers who bragged about holdings online [are having their fathers kidnapped(https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/05/04/abducted-dad-of-crypto-firm-boss-freed-in-french-police-raid_6740891_7.html). That [Coinbase data breach](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/coinbase-breach-linked-customer-data-leak-india-sources-say-2025-06-02/) exposing customer balances and addresses? Shopping list for criminals. 

As crypto gets cozy with institutions, it creates bigger targets for criminals. But beyond the wrench attacks, there's the bigger irony. Crypto ended up embracing the exact corruption it claimed to solve. Trump's crypto empire is a [tangled mess of LLCs](https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-85/) that would embarrass a money launderer.

Circle, co-founded by Jeremy Allaire (who started the Allaire company where I worked in the 90s, which led to General Catalyst funding both Rishi's company and mine), IPO'd in June and the stock is up over 650% from its offering price. They [shut out the crypto funds](https://www.ar.ca/blog/circle-ipo-is-the-antithesis-of-crypto-ethos) that supported them for years and gave fat allocations to Wall Street firms who probably don't even have crypto wallets. So much for rewarding your community.

We're watching the creation of a whole new category of government-endorsed financial instruments. Stablecoins and memecoins are getting the legitimacy treatment, just like mortgage-backed securities did before 2008. [Caroline Crenshaw at the SEC calls it "regulatory Jenga"](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-sec-speaks-051925) - Pulling oversight pieces until everything falls down. She's getting 2008 vibes.

The mainstream adoption is complete. Open Revolut or N26. Crypto trading sits right there on the home screen, positioned as just another investment option. No mention that unlike stocks / bonds, their only purpose is laundering and speculation.

The system combines the worst of both worlds: decentralized enough to dodge oversight, but captured by political money. Your wealth gets leaked in data breaches while regulations get written by whoever pays most. No protection from traditional finance, no freedom from government capture. [Molly White has been documenting this whole mess](https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-85/), from the Trump connection diagrams to everything else.

The original idea was probably impossible anyway. But this government-backed gambling with criminal side effects? Way worse.
