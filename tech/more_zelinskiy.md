More Zelenskiy! He wasn’t rude or disrespectful. He just asked a simple question: If we need diplomacy to counter Russian aggression, what kind of diplomacy is that? Should he be ushered from the White House for a reasonable question? Is this pure defiance?

Well, yes. It actually is. And we need more of it.

Defiance is what leaders do! They speak their minds. They stay true to their beliefs. They don't kiss people's asses just because they're powerful or rich.

There's a great book about defiance called [Defy](https://www.amazon.com/Defy-Power-World-That-Demands), by Sunita Sha. I suggest you read it. You'll learn about some strange but universal human behavior - that we often go along with people we don't trust, and the more we distrust them, the more we go along with them. Crazy, but true.

Defiance is the antidote to this disease. Turn up the Zelinskiy. At work, at home, with your peers, and here on LinkedIn.
