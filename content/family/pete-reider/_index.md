He died on August 13, 2015. [Read his obituary](/family/pete-reider/obituary/).

He self-published a little book called Stepping Stones a few years before his death. Here's what he wrote on the back cover:

*These writings, produced in the last fifteen years, reflect the journey from work as a psychiatrist to retirement. I retired in 2003. I then became a member of the Osher Foundation Lifelong Learning Institute at Brandeis University and the Fromm Institute at the University of San Francisco. I have been trying to expand my ability to play, exploring my role as husband, father and grandparent. I wouldn't say that humor is everything, but it's scary to think of life without it.*
