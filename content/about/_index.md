![my family](/images/matt/paris99.png)

I'm an American expat living in Vienna with my wife and kids. Initially, I wrote short posts about our travels but lately I've been exploring other topics.

I have two teenagers at the Vienna International School, and a lovely wife who loves to read and hates to cook.

I've worked in software for almost 30 years. These days I focus on Kubernetes and OpenTelemetry and work for Dynatrace here in Vienna.

I try to stay active. Enjoy hiking, walking, etc. I listen to late 90's Beastie Boys-type things, Radiohead-type things, and Yacht Rock from the 70's. I watch Louis C.K., Chris Rock, and Dave Chapelle-sorts of things. I've re-watched The Matrix at least twenty times, and enjoy any movie starring Tom Hanks.
