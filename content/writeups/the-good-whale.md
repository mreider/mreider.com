Before you start reading this, know that I'm about to spoil the story. If you're interested in listening to the podcast, stop here.

I just finished [Good Whale](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/podcasts/serial-good-whale.html), a Serial podcast about the orca that starred in Free Willy. After the movie wrapped, activists spent a decade trying to reintroduce Keiko to the wild. It's an emotional listen. You become attached to this killer whale along the way.

There are so many strange layers to this story. First, there's the obvious irony: Keiko was the star of Free Willy, but the exact traits that made him a great movie whale made him a terrible candidate for rewilding. He never fit in with the pods he eventually encountered in Iceland. He was always alone.

Then there's the bizarre fact that some people employed to help Keiko reintegrate were the same ones who had cared for him at the Oregon theme park where he was relocated, or who worked for places like SeaWorld. The strangest case was Jeff, a SeaWorld employee who had likely captured and sold Keiko as a calf to a Mexican theme park, the same place where the Free Willy team found him and made him a star. From abductor to potential liberator, full circle.

The podcast makes clear that Keiko was incapable of truly succeeding in the wild. He was far too accustomed to being petted, scratched, and played with by humans, and especially to being fed. After a decade of slow progress, it sounds like he learned to feed himself somewhat, though the podcast never confirms this clearly. He does eventually make it from a cordoned-off bay into the open ocean, swimming 1,000 miles to Norway (alone, not with a pod) where humans spot him and identify the famous whale. Once again, he's spoiled with free food and belly scratches, reinforcing that life with humans is what he prefers, or simply what he understands.

One of the hardest parts to listen to was when they played the sounds Keiko made while swimming near a pod of other orcas and compared them. They had nothing in common. One of the sounds the other orcas made is supposedly like a laugh, but Keiko didn't even know how to make it. As host Daniel Alarcón put it, the other orcas wouldn't interact with the weird guy in the corner, and Keiko didn't know what to say to them either. By separating this whale from his pod at such a young age, they essentially created an antisocial outcast. Which makes sense. The same would happen to any animal, or human, excluded from normal interactions and kept in isolation, learning to perform tricks for food.

I do recommend the podcast. It's captivating and holds your attention. I also found it interesting that as a listener, you become attached to this animal in exactly the same way so many handlers, researchers, admirers, and fundraisers did. We project feelings onto the whale that we have no idea it's experiencing. But the podcast makes you aware of this throughout, and you end up questioning whether what you're feeling for Keiko, relating to his supposed emotions, is nothing more than manipulation by the podcast, combined with the fantasy stories in our heads and our inability to stop anthropomorphizing animals, especially those we domesticate, feed, or control.
