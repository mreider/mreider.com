I just finished [Good Whale](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/podcasts/serial-good-whale.html), a Serial podcast about the orca that starred in Free Willy. It's an emotional listen.

Before you continue, know that I'm about to spoil the story. If you're interested in listening to the podcast, stop here.

It takes six episodes to learn what happens to Keiko. Here it is in one paragraph: 

In the early 1990s, Keiko was captured from his pod as a calf and shipped to a Mexican theme park where he learned to do tricks for frozen fish. Hollywood found him and made him a star in the movie Free Willy. After the movie's release, a news exposé revealed his poor living conditions, and activists spent a decade and millions of dollars trying to reintroduce him to the wild. They moved him to a larger tank in Oregon, then flew him to Iceland where he was originally captured.

Keiko was perfect for Free Willy for the same reasons he was terrible for rewilding. He was too accustomed to being fed, petted, scratched, and played with by humans. By separating him from his pod so young, they'd created an antisocial outcast.

One of the saddest parts of the podcast was hearing the sounds Keiko made near the orcas in Iceland. His sounds, compared to theirs, had nothing in common. As the host Daniel Alarcón put it, the other orcas wouldn't interact with the weird guy in the corner, and Keiko didn't know what to say to them either.

The people involved in Keiko's reintroduction to the ocean are the same ones who work at places like SeaWorld. The strangest case was Jeff, a SeaWorld employee who had likely captured and sold Keiko as a calf to that Mexican theme park in the first place. From abductor to potential liberator, Jeff gets to redeem himself through this effort, except the whale never actually gets free.

After a decade of slow progress, Keiko eventually makes it from the cordoned-off bay in Iceland into the open ocean, swimming 1,000 miles to Norway. Alone, not with a pod. There, humans spotted and identified the famous whale. Once again, he got free food and belly scratches, reinforcing that life with humans was what he preferred, or simply what he understood. In the end, he died beached on a shore, too tired and sick to stay afloat.

The series is about saving Keiko's life. Though his life could have been saved by just not doing any of it. Not capturing him as a calf, not moving him around, and not making a podcast about it.

But this did all happen, including the podcast, which I do recommend. The Serial producers know how to keep you hooked episode to episode, wondering if Keiko will make it. You get attached and project emotions onto him just like everyone else did. It's entertaining to listen to, made like the good shows we watch on Netflix or Apple TV. But this show, like the performances Keiko used to give in Mexico, is done at his expense.
