Last night my wife invited me out to see [The Fifth Step](https://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/events/the-fifth-step), a Scottish stage play that has been recorded for movie goers and streamers. It stars Jack Lowden, who I know from the show Slow Horses, and Martin Freeman who's been in a bunch of stuff. My favorite role of his is the sociopathic weakling midwestern used car dealer Lester Nygaard in the TV series Fargo.

The play is done in-the-round, meaning the audience completely surrounds the stage, which in this case is actually a square. The actors perform the entire play in a single act without any breaks. Sometimes the lights dim and they move the chairs and table around to show the scenes are changing. The result is a more three-dimensional feeling since the camera records them from all angles. When they get fidgety, anxious, relieved, or angry, the camera angles and close-ups make you feel part of what they're feeling.

The two characters, James (Freeman) and Luka (Lowden), are recovering alcoholics in an AA program. James is the power figure, Luka's sponsor. He's aloof, educated, critical, judgmental, and condescending - always questioning Luka and the decisions he's making. Luka is more of a dimwit Scottish roughneck type.

Without giving too much away, I think the play was really about questioning the right way to go through life and address our suffering. I related to James for most of the play because his body language, the things he said, and the wisdom he was giving seemed like the right stuff, despite the chip on his shoulder and that know-it-all grin on his face. Predictably the play starts to push these two characters around in such a way that you wonder which one really has the right approach to alcoholism, or all of humanity's problems for that matter.

This shifting of who you trust and believe in tracks with the fidgeting of Luka's hands and his blinky pent-up energy. At the beginning it feels agitating to watch, and it's a relief as it dissipates through the performance. 

Glad my wife, Alison, asked me to join her. Definitely had a good time watching it and thinking about it afterwards.
