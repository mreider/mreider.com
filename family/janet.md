Digital has replaced film. The Hasselblad snoozes on a closet shelf. I am more apt to capture aspects of people â€” young mothers in rapt conversation while their children argue over a plastic toy, the focused energy of men on a park bench talking politics and dedication of a sunbather on a bridge.

There's a lot more information about my work at [janetreider.com](https://janetreider.com).
