He died on August 13, 2015. Pete's obituary is [here](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/sfgate/name/arthur-reider-obituary?id=16690573)

He self-published a little book called Stepping Stones a few years before his death. Here's what he wrote on the back cover.

These writings. produced in the last fifteen years, reflect the journey from work as a psychiatrist to retirement. I retired in 2003. I then became a member of the Osher Foundation Lifelong Learning Institute at Brandeis University and the Fromm Institute at the University of San Francisco. I have been trying to expand my ability to play, exploring my role as husband, father and grandparent. I wouldn't say that humor is everything. but it's scary to think of life without it.

The stories in his book are available at [here](../dad/index.md)
