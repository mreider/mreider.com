Deb wrote a One Boy about raising her son, Caleb (my cousin), after the passing of her husband and Caleb's father. This is the illustration on the front cover that Caleb created when he was a young boy.

Here's what she wrote on the back cover:

I consult about and edit early stages of books, as a developmental editor. I did this for faculty at the University of Washington Medical School, and other books, including Aaron Dixon's account of his experience as a leader with the Black Panther Party, and a book by Jerry Mander of San Francisco. 

I was manuscript editor at Ramparts magazine, assistant editor at Tesol Quarterly, and manuscript assistant to the Editor of the medical journal Epilepsia.
