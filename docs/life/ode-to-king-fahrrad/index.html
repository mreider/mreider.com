But no, it’s not about that. <em>Ein Fahrrad</em> just means “a bicycle.” And this long-overdue blog post is about my bicycle and what it’s like to use it around town. Whoa. Calm down. You’re too excited.</p><p>Last fall, I bought a used bicycle for €170 from <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/ijv5ky1szcRvYkSu5>B7 Cycling Center</a>, a shop that hires former inmates and trains them as mechanics. The brand name on my bike’s frame says <em>“Heavy Tool.”</em> Literal translations are hilarious, aren’t they?</p><p>My friend Florian, one of a trillion Florians, taught me an alternative name for <em>Fahrrad</em>. The word is <em>&ldquo;Drahtesel,&rdquo;</em> which translates to &ldquo;wire donkey.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s good stuff.</p><p>Here’s my donkey:</p><p><img src=/images/matt/1_tXar3KaCPlH809fUO63_ZQ.jpeg alt="My Bike"></p><p>It&rsquo;s not fancy, just a little commuter bike. But it does have a few tricks up its sleeve. The front light is powered by kinetic energy, a common feature in Europe, but something that disappeared in America decades ago.</p><p><img src=/images/matt/1_rnCPYtSKT0v_5dUNdaxP8w.png alt="How it works"></p><p>It also has a tail light connected to the same circuit. I’m looking forward to using it again in the fall. During summer, there’s no need since the sun doesn’t set until around 9:00 PM.</p><hr><h2 id=commuting-on-my-fahrrad>Commuting on My Fahrrad</h2><p>I commute on my <em>Fahrrad</em> a few times a week. It’s only a 15-minute ride, and the route is flat and streamlined for bicycles.</p><p><img src=/images/matt/commute.png alt="My Commute"></p><p>Austria takes bicycles seriously. Kids under 12 must pass a test to ride on the street, it&rsquo;s like a driver&rsquo;s license for bikes. Drunk biking is also taken seriously: if you&rsquo;re caught, you lose your right to drive a car.</p><p>Bicycles aren’t allowed on sidewalks unless the sidewalk is marked for it. While I haven’t seen the <em>Polizei</em> enforce this rule, I’ve heard stories. Many sidewalks are split, with pedestrians on the right and bikes on the left.</p><p><img src=/images/matt/image-1.png alt="Bike lanes"></p><p>Bicycles even get their own traffic lights. Here’s a sidewalk light with a walking figure and a bike icon side by side:</p><p><img src=/images/matt/image-2.png alt="Bike traffic lights"></p><p>Even crosswalk buttons have little bicycle icons on them:</p><p><img src=/images/matt/image-3.png alt="Bike traffic lights"></p><p>And here’s a common sign marking a split sidewalk, along with lane indicators painted on the ground:</p><p><img src=/images/matt/1_qslqFHQK5gVYZUsCgsfAoQ.jpeg alt="More bike lanes"></p><hr><h2 id=biking-culture-in-austria>Biking Culture in Austria</h2><p>Most stores have bike racks, and they&rsquo;re heavily used. You see older folks biking around far more often than in America. Here&rsquo;s a guy who looks like he&rsquo;s in his 70s, loading groceries onto his trusty steed. <em>Er braucht nicht auto, verstehst?</em></p><p><img src=/images/matt/1_3t3ZyRcXQpnY7rwNOLAXiA.jpeg alt="Bikes at the store"></p><p>At my office, there’s a bike rack outside the building. Most people lock their bikes, but a few don’t. It’s surprisingly trusting. I’ve never heard of a stolen bike here, although leaving one unlocked in the city center is riskier.</p><p><img src=/images/matt/1_dZwkMaH2-eBXJS5t2dvk6A.jpeg alt="Bikes at the office"></p><p>Our office building has six floors. The elevator signs show that the garage includes a bike room. It’s still funny to me that the first floor is called “zero,” and the basement is “minus one.”</p><p><img src=/images/matt/image-4.png alt="Elevator sign"></p><p>The bike room is accessed with a key card.</p><p><img src=/images/matt/image-5.png alt="Bike room"></p><p>If you visit the <em>minus one</em> basement parking garage, you’ll see it’s nicely marked and color-coded: yellow for bikes, blue for cars.</p><p><img src=/images/matt/image-5.png alt="Bike lane garage"></p><p>Here’s the inside of the bike room. Spacious! Before COVID-19, it was tough to find a spot. Now it’s practically empty.</p><p><img src=/images/matt/1_sc5Q4M_sW7onjXHcBayHog.jpeg alt="Bike room interior"></p><hr><h2 id=thoughts-on-bicycles-and-king-fahd>Thoughts on Bicycles and King Fahd</h2><p>So now you know all about bicycles, first-class Austrian transportation. It&rsquo;s funny that the word <em>&ldquo;Fahrrad&rdquo;</em> reminds me of King Fahd, since Saudi Arabia is the world&rsquo;s largest oil producer. Bikes are a solution to our oil addiction, something King Fahd probably wouldn&rsquo;t have appreciated. Maybe my subconscious enjoys the irony.</p></div><nav class=post-nav><div><a href=https://mreider.com/life/its-snowing/>← It's Snowing</a></div><div><a href=https://mreider.com/life/wasser/>Wasser, Acqua, Voda →</a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="site-footer text-center"><p class=webring><a href=https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/previous rel=nofollow>←</a>
