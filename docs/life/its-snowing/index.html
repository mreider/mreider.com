I put on some ski gear and rode my bike to work, alongside dozens of other people doing the same.</p><p>The snow fits the scenery perfectly. Linz is fully decked out for Christmas. Lights are strung above the streets: clear lights, globes, stars, and multi-colored spirals.</p><p>Linz boasts three different Christmas markets within a half-mile radius. The market at Main Square has tasty Glühwein. Volksgarten features classical music, animatronic elves, and a Ferris wheel. Pfarrplatz even has a petting zoo.</p><p>Last weekend, we went to a Christmas gospel concert at the cathedral. The lead singer spoke fluent German, which the audience loved. He must have a connection to Austria; he&rsquo;s been performing here every year for over a decade.</p><p><img src=/images/matt/image-7.png alt=cathedral></p><p>The next day, we attended a small party hosted by friends who are also from the Bay Area. I tried speaking a little German with their neighbors, but it wasn’t happening. We stuck to English.</p><h3 id=on-learning-german>On Learning German</h3><p>I expected Max and Zoe to pick up German faster than Alison and I would, but we’re all progressing at about the same pace. Almost every store, restaurant, movie theater, or office in Linz has some English, so intensive language training doesn’t feel essential.</p><p>At home, Alison and I practice German using an app called Duolingo. I also listen to a German podcast produced by an Irish guy who learns along with his listeners. Once a week, there’s a German class at my work, and Alison and I are both taking extracurricular classes. Mine starts Friday.</p><p>We’ve gotten comfortable with numbers, but calculating in German is tricky because the structure is reversed. Instead of saying “twenty-two,” you say “two and twenty.” That split second of translating in my head often causes me to miss whatever comes next.</p><p>Telling time is flipped too. 8:30 is “half nine,” not “half past eight.”</p><p>And then there are the articles. What a mess.</p><p>“The” is an article. French, Italian, and Spanish use gendered articles, so the form changes with the gender of the noun. For example, in Spanish: <em>el niño</em> (the boy, masculine) and <em>la niña</em> (the girl, feminine).</p><p>Like Spanish, German has masculine and feminine articles, but it also has a neutral article. <em>Der</em> (masculine), <em>die</em> (feminine), and <em>das</em> (neutral).</p><p>For instance:</p><ul><li><em>Der Junge</em> (the boy, masculine).</li><li><em>Das Mädchen</em> (the girl, neutral).</li></ul><p>Wait, neutral? Yes, apparently neutral nouns often refer to diminutives, meaning small or cute things. But that rule isn&rsquo;t consistent. For example, <em>die kleine Katze</em> (the little cat) is feminine. Why? No one knows. Kill me.</p><p>To make things even more confusing, the ending of a noun doesn’t always help. <em>Der Junge</em> ends in “e,” so you might think all nouns ending in “e” are masculine. Nope. <em>Die Katze</em> (feminine) ends in “e” too. You just have to memorize the article for each word.</p><p>And it gets worse. Articles change based on the noun’s role in the sentence. For example:</p><ul><li><em>Der Hund</em> (the dog, masculine) when it’s the subject.</li><li><em>Den Hund</em> (the dog, masculine) when it’s the direct object.</li></ul><p>Possessive articles are another layer of fun. Can’t wait to tackle those.</p><p>Then there’s sentence structure. German loves to put the second verb at the very end of the sentence. For example:</p><ul><li>“I would like you and your wife to join us for dinner next week” translates to:<br>“I want you and your wife next week dinner with us join.”</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s like a slow reveal. You know it&rsquo;s about dinner, but the action isn&rsquo;t clear until the very last word. Eat dinner? Cook dinner? Regurgitate dinner? Oh, join! You want us to <em>join</em> you for dinner. Sorry, we can&rsquo;t.</p><p>For now, the slow reveal isn&rsquo;t too overwhelming because our vocabulary is still limited. But as we learn more words, I imagine it&rsquo;ll feel like the flipped numbers: a brief pause to figure things out, and the rest of the sentence is lost.</p><p>The word for “repeat” is <em>wiederholen</em>. It feels appropriate.</p><p>To summarize: Christmas is here. German is hard. :)</p><p>Time to sign off and earn my daily Duolingo points before bed.</p><p><em>Gute Nacht!</em></p></div><nav class=post-nav><div><a href=https://mreider.com/life/infinite-tunnels/>← Infinite Tunnels</a></div><div><a href=https://mreider.com/life/ode-to-king-fahrrad/>Ode to Kine Fahrrad →</a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="site-footer text-center"><p class=webring><a href=https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/previous rel=nofollow>←</a>
