If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in listening to the podcast, stop here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/podcasts/serial-good-whale.html"&gt;Good Whale&lt;/a&gt;, a Serial podcast about the orca that starred in Free Willy. After the movie wrapped, activists spent a decade trying to reintroduce Keiko to the wild. It&amp;rsquo;s an emotional listen. You become attached to this killer whale along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many strange layers to this story. First, there&amp;rsquo;s the obvious irony: Keiko was the star of Free Willy, but the exact traits that made him a great movie whale made him a terrible candidate for rewilding. He never fit in with the pods he eventually encountered in Iceland. He was always alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
