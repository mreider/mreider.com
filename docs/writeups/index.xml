It&amp;rsquo;s an emotional listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes six episodes to learn what happens to Keiko. Here it is in one paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1990s, Keiko was captured from his pod as a calf and shipped to a Mexican theme park where he learned to do tricks for frozen fish. Hollywood found him and made him a star in the movie Free Willy. After the movie&amp;rsquo;s release, a news exposé revealed his poor living conditions, and activists spent a decade and millions of dollars trying to reintroduce him to the wild. They moved him to a larger tank in Oregon, then flew him to Iceland where he was originally captured.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
