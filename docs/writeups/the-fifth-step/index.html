It stars Jack Lowden, who I know from the show Slow Horses, and Martin Freeman who&rsquo;s been in a bunch of stuff. My favorite role of his is the sociopathic weakling midwestern used car dealer Lester Nygaard in the TV series Fargo.</p><p>The play is done in-the-round, meaning the audience completely surrounds the stage, which in this case is actually a square. The actors perform the entire play in a single act without any breaks. Sometimes the lights dim and they move the chairs and table around to show the scenes are changing. The result is a more three-dimensional feeling since the camera records them from all angles. When they get anxious, or angry, the camera angles and close-ups make you feel what they&rsquo;re feeling.</p><p>The two characters, James (Freeman) and Luka (Lowden), are recovering alcoholics in an AA program. James is the power figure, Luka&rsquo;s sponsor. He&rsquo;s wise, but aloof and condescending - always questioning Luka and the decisions he&rsquo;s making. Luka is more of a dimwit Scottish roughneck type.</p><p>Without giving too much away, I think the play was about questioning the right way to address human suffering. I related to James&rsquo; approach for most of the play because the advice he gave seemed like the right stuff, despite the chip on his shoulder and the know-it-all grin on his face. But as things progress, you wonder which one really has the best approach to alcoholism, or any of humanity&rsquo;s problems for that matter.</p><p>This shifting of who you trust and believe in tracks with the fidgeting of Luka&rsquo;s hands and his blinky pent-up energy. At the beginning it feels agitating to watch, and it&rsquo;s a relief as it dissipates through the performance.</p><p>Glad my wife, Alison, asked me to join her. Definitely had a good time watching it and thinking about it afterwards.</p></div><nav class="mt-5 pt-4 border-top"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between gap-3"><div><a href=https://mreider.com/writeups/leonard-and-hungry-paul/ class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary">← Previous: Leonard and Hungry Paul</a></div><div></div></div></nav><footer class="text-center mt-5">Generated with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></footer></div></div><script src=/js/bootstrap.js></script></body></html>
