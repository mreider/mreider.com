Unlike other hyped technologies that promised future revolutions, AI delivers immediate value anyone can experience. People can jump onto ChatGPT and use it to write a poem, draft an email, or provide information that previously required a Google search. This immediate utility has transformed AI from industry jargon into a household term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s clarify what we&amp;rsquo;re discussing: Autonomous AI operates independently without human oversight. Agentic AI refers to multiple AI systems working together autonomously. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) means human-level intelligence across all domains. While Autonomous and Agentic AI exist today but have limited application in high-stakes situations, AGI doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist at all - though many discuss it as inevitable without defining what it actually means.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Email Subscriptions from Static Blogs</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/email-subscriptions-from-static-blogs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/email-subscriptions-from-static-blogs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="krems_static_site_generator.md"&gt;last blog entry&lt;/a&gt;, I introduced Krems, a project I built for generating static blogs. One of the challenges with static blogs is their inability to run server-side code or databases, which makes storing email addresses for blog subscriptions impossible. To work around this, you can either use a paid service like &lt;a href="https://rssfeedpulse.com"&gt;rssfeedpulse.com&lt;/a&gt; to scrape your RSS feed and email new posts to subscribers, or you can encourage readers to follow your blog using an RSS reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Krems static blog generator</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/krems-static-site-generator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/krems-static-site-generator/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago we visited a little town named Krems about an hour West of Vienna. In that little town is a University where my son would apply, though now that he’s been accepted to a few schools in Scotland he likely won’t attend. After we returned to Vienna I thought about writing a short blog about our visit there, but to my horror my blog was nolonger loading properly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sudowrite, ChatGPT, and AI Slop</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/sudowrite-chatgpt-and-ai-slop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/sudowrite-chatgpt-and-ai-slop/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write a novel - a character-driven thriller. I use ChatGPT here and there, but I try to use it lightly. It&amp;rsquo;s a time-saver for small changes and touch-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, ChatGPT is too general-purpose for writers and often resorts to &amp;ldquo;corporate-speak.&amp;rdquo; This led me to try &lt;a href="https://sudowrite.com"&gt;Sudowrite&lt;/a&gt;, which is built on language models like GPT but designed for aspiring authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudowrite blends AI with structured writing tools and an interface similar to &lt;a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview"&gt;Scrivener&lt;/a&gt;. It understands different forms of writing -from short stories to full-length novels -and supports a handful of genres.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Great Strategy Starts with Sacrifice</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/trade-off-as-strategy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/trade-off-as-strategy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Before I get started, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why I&amp;rsquo;m blogging. I began offering pro-bono product advice, hoping to charge a fee someday. Balancing a full-time job, family, and personal interests didn&amp;rsquo;t work out well. What did work out was writing about other people&amp;rsquo;s challenges. It&amp;rsquo;s freeing since the problems aren&amp;rsquo;t tied to my workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about the importance of sacrifice in product strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a young CEO I worked for explained that certain features would open up a new market segment. He said, &amp;ldquo;See, that&amp;rsquo;s how strategy works.&amp;rdquo; But his &amp;ldquo;strategy&amp;rdquo; lacked something. Sacrifice. Pain. To me, it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like a strategy at all. It was just wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bluesky is almost like 2012 Twitter</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/blue-sky/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/blue-sky/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bluesky is going ok so far. I don&amp;rsquo;t have many followers yet, and I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out who to follow, but it&amp;rsquo;s the closest thing we&amp;rsquo;ve had in years to 2012 Twitter. The one where tech folks could have fun, feel connected, and not drown in nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then we wondered how Twitter would make money. Bluesky is in the same place. But unlike Twitter, which grew organically from a quirky SMS tool, Bluesky isn&amp;rsquo;t organic. It has a clearer sense of what it wants to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMware, Pivotal, and the Rise of Kubernetes</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/pivotal-and-the-rise-of-cloud-foundry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/pivotal-and-the-rise-of-cloud-foundry/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I left Engine Yard (&lt;a href="https://mreider.com/tech/Tales_from_Engineyard.html"&gt;see my earlier post&lt;/a&gt;), I joined VMware to work on the Cloud Foundry team. The idea was ambitious: create a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that allowed developers to write and deploy applications without worrying about infrastructure. It wasn’t revolutionary -Heroku and Engine Yard had similar goals -but it offered something enterprises hadn’t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret weapon was BOSH, a powerful orchestration tool that deployed Cloud Foundry on private or public clouds in a declarative, repeatable way. BOSH had a small but passionate following, with its precision and reliability appealing to those managing complex software deployments. Still, Cloud Foundry itself struggled to balance the needs of developers with the expectations of enterprises. For VMware, it was a critical play to stay relevant as Amazon reshaped the industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building Quacker: A Weekend Project with ChatGPT</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/building-quacker/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/building-quacker/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I built &lt;a href="https://github.com/mreider/quacker"&gt;Quacker&lt;/a&gt;, a Python app that lets static blogs send newsletters. Static blogs are simple, fast, and reliable - but they don&amp;rsquo;t have built-in features like email subscriptions or post notifications. I could&amp;rsquo;ve used something like Ghost, but I spent the weekend reinventing the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quacker does what I need: it adds a subscription form to my blog, stores emails, checks the RSS feed for updates, and sends subscribers an email when there&amp;rsquo;s a new post. It&amp;rsquo;s not fancy, and there are better tools out there, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Engine Yard and the Cost of Venture Capital</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/tales-from-engineyard/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/tales-from-engineyard/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the early days of cloud computing, before &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; meant what it does today, we were one of the original cloud vendors. Our infrastructure ran on custom-patched Gentoo servers -nicknamed &amp;ldquo;pizza boxes&amp;rdquo; -housed in two data centers on opposite coasts. Scaling wasn’t automated. It was manual, requiring real humans to intervene. As our head of support jokingly put it, we were a &amp;ldquo;meat cloud.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we were ahead of the curve, offering a platform as a service (PaaS) for Ruby on Rails apps, MongoDB, and MySQL databases. Developers could push their code, and it “just worked.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
