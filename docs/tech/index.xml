Unlike other hyped technologies that promised future revolutions, AI delivers immediate value anyone can experience. People can jump onto ChatGPT and use it to write a poem, draft an email, or provide information that previously required a Google search. This immediate utility has transformed AI from industry jargon into a household term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s clarify what we&amp;rsquo;re discussing: Autonomous AI operates independently without human oversight. Agentic AI refers to multiple AI systems working together autonomously. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) means human-level intelligence across all domains. While Autonomous and Agentic AI exist today but have limited application in high-stakes situations, AGI doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist at all - though many discuss it as inevitable without defining what it actually means.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building Mastopub: Auto-Posting to Mastodon</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/building-mastopub/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/building-mastopub/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited about the &lt;a href="https://pjvogt.substack.com/p/the-fediverse-experiment"&gt;Forkiverse experiment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, the folks behind Hard Fork and Search Engine (&lt;a href="https://theforkiverse.com/@kevin"&gt;@kevin@theforkiverse.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theforkiverse.com/@Casey"&gt;@Casey@theforkiverse.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://theforkiverse.com/@pj"&gt;@pj@theforkiverse.com&lt;/a&gt;) have launched their own Mastodon instance. The current internet is arguably the worst it&amp;rsquo;s ever been, so instead of just complaining about it, they&amp;rsquo;re building a small alternative. A bot-free mini-world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not theoretical. These are tech journalists who&amp;rsquo;ve spent years covering social media, and now they&amp;rsquo;re actually trying the decentralized alternative themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Great Strategy Starts with Sacrifice</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/trade-off-as-strategy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/trade-off-as-strategy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Before I get started, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why I&amp;rsquo;m blogging. I began offering pro-bono product advice, hoping to charge a fee someday. Balancing a full-time job, family, and personal interests didn&amp;rsquo;t work out well. What did work out was writing about other people&amp;rsquo;s challenges. It&amp;rsquo;s freeing since the problems aren&amp;rsquo;t tied to my workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about the importance of sacrifice in product strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a young CEO I worked for explained that certain features would open up a new market segment. He said, &amp;ldquo;See, that&amp;rsquo;s how strategy works.&amp;rdquo; But his &amp;ldquo;strategy&amp;rdquo; lacked something. Sacrifice. Pain. To me, it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like a strategy at all. It was just wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bluesky is almost like 2012 Twitter</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/blue-sky/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/blue-sky/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bluesky is going ok so far. I don&amp;rsquo;t have many followers yet, and I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out who to follow, but it&amp;rsquo;s the closest thing we&amp;rsquo;ve had in years to 2012 Twitter. The one where tech folks could have fun, feel connected, and not drown in nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then we wondered how Twitter would make money. Bluesky is in the same place. But unlike Twitter, which grew organically from a quirky SMS tool, Bluesky isn&amp;rsquo;t organic. It has a clearer sense of what it wants to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Certainty, Ambivalence, and Product Leadership</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/on-ambivalence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/on-ambivalence/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Every night at 9:00 PM, I walk my dog, Leo, while listening to podcasts. I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to &lt;strong&gt;Hidden Brain&lt;/strong&gt; with Shankar Vedantam. In a &lt;a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/the-benefits-of-mixed-emotions/"&gt;recent episode&lt;/a&gt;, Naomi Rothman talked about how society values leaders who project certainty over ambivalence - often favoring confidence even when it&amp;rsquo;s based on incomplete or inaccurate information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothman cited a study where CEOs who admitted uncertainty during earnings calls were judged more harshly and seen as less competent, even though they were being honest.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Doing It for Yourself</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/doing-it-for-yourself/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/doing-it-for-yourself/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a conversation with a product manager from another company that left me thinking. Every time he referred to an initiative, he called it &amp;ldquo;mine.&amp;rdquo; Deadlines and priorities were framed as &amp;ldquo;important for me&amp;rdquo; - not for the team, not for the users, but for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one level, this is human nature. We all bring some degree of self-interest to the work we do. But when a product manager frames everything this way, it stops feeling like a team effort and starts looking like a personal project tied to their ego.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMware, Pivotal, and the Rise of Kubernetes</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/pivotal-and-the-rise-of-cloud-foundry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/pivotal-and-the-rise-of-cloud-foundry/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I left Engine Yard (&lt;a href="https://mreider.com/tech/Tales_from_Engineyard.html"&gt;see my earlier post&lt;/a&gt;), I joined VMware to work on the Cloud Foundry team. The idea was ambitious: create a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that allowed developers to write and deploy applications without worrying about infrastructure. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t revolutionary. Heroku and Engine Yard had similar goals, but it offered something enterprises hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret weapon was BOSH, a powerful orchestration tool that deployed Cloud Foundry on private or public clouds in a declarative, repeatable way. BOSH had a small but passionate following, with its precision and reliability appealing to those managing complex software deployments. Still, Cloud Foundry itself struggled to balance the needs of developers with the expectations of enterprises. For VMware, it was a critical play to stay relevant as Amazon reshaped the industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Founders Don’t Need a Strategist as the First PM</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/henchman-or-hero/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/henchman-or-hero/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently spoke with the CEO of a small, profitable startup. Let&amp;rsquo;s call him Mike. His company pulls in a few million dollars a year with a lean team. They&amp;rsquo;ve made it past the survival stage, but now they&amp;rsquo;re grappling with the next big question: how to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike&amp;rsquo;s team is stuck on a familiar startup dilemma: which user to prioritize. Mike wants to focus on buyers, adding features like loyalty programs, promotions, and customer acquisition tools. His team is more focused on the practitioners - reducing pain points, automating workflows, and fixing bugs. This is a split in who the team believes matters most.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Engine Yard and the Cost of Venture Capital</title><link>https://mreider.com/tech/tales-from-engineyard/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/tech/tales-from-engineyard/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the early days of cloud computing, before &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; meant what it does today, we were one of the original cloud vendors. Our infrastructure ran on custom-patched Gentoo servers, nicknamed &amp;ldquo;pizza boxes,&amp;rdquo; housed in two data centers on opposite coasts. Scaling wasn&amp;rsquo;t automated. It was manual, requiring real humans to intervene. As our head of support jokingly put it, we were a &amp;ldquo;meat cloud.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we were ahead of the curve, offering a platform as a service (PaaS) for Ruby on Rails apps, MongoDB, and MySQL databases. Developers could push their code, and it “just worked.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
