· by <a href=/authors/matt-reider/>Matt Reider</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>I&rsquo;m trying to write a novel - a character-driven thriller. I use ChatGPT here and there, but I try to use it lightly. It&rsquo;s a time-saver for small changes and touch-ups.</p><p>However, ChatGPT is too general-purpose for writers and often resorts to &ldquo;corporate-speak.&rdquo; This led me to try <a href=https://sudowrite.com>Sudowrite</a>, which is built on language models like GPT but designed for aspiring authors.</p><p>Sudowrite blends AI with structured writing tools and an interface similar to <a href=https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview>Scrivener</a>. It understands different forms of writing, from short stories to full-length novels, and supports a handful of genres.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t buy it, but I was impressed.</p><p>Sudowrite offers a guided process. It asks you to brainstorm, write a synopsis, and describe the tone, characters, and setting. These elements form the story &ldquo;bible.&rdquo; Once you&rsquo;ve completed it, you can modify or even generate your prose.</p><p>Aside from the AI features, Sudowrite helps authors organize their story elements. It&rsquo;s similar to an early version of Scrivener from a small British company called Literature and Latte. Like Literature and Latte, Sudowrite sponsors and promotes workshops and resources to help writers improve their craft.</p><p>Much like ChatGPT, Sudowrite&rsquo;s quality suffers the further it strays from your original text. However, its starting point, compared to ChatGPT, is closer to something you might download on your Kindle.</p><p>As I <a href=Building_Quacker.md>previously blogged about</a>, complex tasks aren&rsquo;t GPT&rsquo;s strong suit. It works best in simple increments. Sudowrite is built with this in mind, offering small, digestible &ldquo;cards&rdquo; of suggestions or edits rather than attempting to tackle an entire project at once.</p><p>And yet, this &ldquo;all-at-once&rdquo; approach seems popular. In Sudowrite&rsquo;s Discord community, users generate complete chapters rather than modify their own work.</p><p>This seems ideal for Sudowrite’s business model, as it likely encourages high usage and premium subscriptions.</p><p>Generating text, rather than modifying your own, results in a mediocre novel - readable but boring. Compared to a good book, it&rsquo;s cardboard.</p><p>The supply side of the book market is going to be flooded with mediocre writing. AI won&rsquo;t help separate signal from noise artistically.</p><p>I do see the allure. Few people ever complete a book, and there&rsquo;s satisfaction in bringing an idea to life, even with shortcuts.</p><p>If you use the tool&rsquo;s cards and modify rather than generate, it is helpful. Not helpful enough for me to become a customer. I already pay for ChatGPT, and it can fix my grammar and smooth rough edges.</p><p>AI is a big piece of my novel&rsquo;s storyline. Flooding the market with poorly crafted writing, music, and video for profit is relatively harmless. But the slop this new tech sector encourages is disappointing.</p></div><nav class=post-nav><div><a href=https://mreider.com/tech/trade-off-as-strategy/>← Great Strategy Starts with Sacrifice</a></div><div><a href=https://mreider.com/tech/krems-static-site-generator/>Krems static blog generator →</a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="site-footer text-center"><p class=webring><a href=https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/previous rel=nofollow>←</a>
