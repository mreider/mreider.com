Well, no one does this really all the time. It&rsquo;s just that&mldr; I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing. [He looks at her expectantly]</p><p>** She **</p><p>[almost a monotone] I enjoy hiking, cooking and yoga.</p><p>** He **</p><p>[trying to sound enthusiastic] Great! I like to hike. I&rsquo;m not much at cooking - the timing, you know, having everything come together at the same time - that&rsquo;s not my forte. Matter of fact I don&rsquo;t know how anyone gets everything done simultaneously. [He dramatizes the hostess in a falsetto voice.] &ldquo;Dinner is served!&rdquo; Yoga, well&mldr; [He fades off]</p><p>** She **</p><p>[mechanically] I&rsquo;m seeking a nonsmoking, successful, trustworthy man, 55-72.</p><p>** He **</p><p>Trustworthy. [He repeats the word slowly and deliberately.] Let me just blurt this out. Okay? [Her expression remains blank.] I&rsquo;m married. There, I&rsquo;ve said it. Guess that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so nervous - not knowing how you&rsquo;ll react. I love my wife, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. But&mldr; I&rsquo;d like to explain. Okay? She&rsquo;s not excited by me. That&rsquo;s not so unusual. [guffaw] After all, after 46 years what would I expect? I&rsquo;m not complaining. On the other hand, I want to see what&rsquo;s out there. No.. [shakes his head] Not what. You. You in particular. I want to get to know you. Maybe she&rsquo;s not the one for me. I&rsquo;ll never know if I don&rsquo;t take the risk. Sixty-eight, you know.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sixty-eight. Well I am. And that&rsquo;s no spring chicken.[He smiles like a stand-up comic.] What is a spring chicken anyway? [She remains impassive.] She, my wife, she&rsquo;s not bad. I mean not a bad person. It&rsquo;s just that she doesn&rsquo;t show her caring. Not demonstrative. I want to know whether my expectations are unreal. You might ask, what&rsquo;s in it for you?</p><p>** She **</p><p>I enjoy hiking, cross-country skiing, dinner in cozy restaurants.</p><p>** He **</p><p>[He looks off to the side as if to say to an audience, Do you believe this? He faces her again trying to sound upbeat.] Yes! Love cross country skiing - sitting on your skis, so quiet and peaceful, just the sound of occasional snow falling off a pine branch: plop, plop. Love it. And dinners. Oh yeah. We would definitely include that. Big time. Restaurant of your choice. Sky&rsquo;s the limit. No problem. Because you deserve it - deserve the best, you know what I mean? I&rsquo;m there for you.</p><p>** She **</p><p>Art, tennis, sailing.</p><p>** He **</p><p>[sounding a little crestfallen] Yeah. I&rsquo;m with you on all three counts. So, I hope you can understand. I&rsquo;m not promising anything, except, that is, a good time. No, I don&rsquo;t mean a good time, not in the sense of a fling, a one night stand. Of course, I don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;good time&rdquo; that way. This is about respect.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m devoted to the arts.</p><p>** He **</p><p>I&rsquo;m not being critical. You have a way-it&rsquo;s quite charming - of talking about yourself that some would find&mldr; indirect. I&rsquo;m curious to know things. I mean, I know <em>some</em> things about you such as that you&rsquo;re an enormously attractive tech writing college graduate in midlife. From your ad I know that. And now that you&rsquo;re sitting right here across from me&mldr; I can see that. I can&rsquo;t actually see the tech writing college graduate part, but who would question?</p><p>As you say, you look great. I can see why, as you said in your ad, you&rsquo;re often asked <em>Why don&rsquo;t you model?</em> I want to deepen the relationship. Not all the way, of course. A relationship takes time. <em>I</em> know that. But I need something to hang my hat on - in a manner of speaking. You&rsquo;re single?</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m sparkling, bold, international.</p><p>** He **</p><p>And single? [laughing more genuinely than before] You&rsquo;re single. right?</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m tall, slender, graceful.</p><p>** He **</p><p>[displaying a lunatic smile.] Single, skingle? Ha, ha, ha. Waiting, waiting&mldr; Jingle, jingle?</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m an engaging Goldie Hawn look-alike with no baggage.</p><p>** He **</p><p>Okay. So you&rsquo;re not single. That&rsquo;s fine - just a surprise. Same as you were surprised when I said I was married. Not that you Looked surprised. You didn&rsquo;t appear surprised. Maybe inwardly, but, of course, I can&rsquo;t see inwardly. [He stops to take a breath.] You&rsquo;re getting a divorce? Not quite single?</p><p>** She **</p><p>I have head-turning good looks.</p><p>** He **</p><p>[He looks at her incredulously] Yeah. [He adopts a serious tone.] Yes you have head-turning good looks. But is that right on target? Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m being critical. Acceptance. That&rsquo;s me. I&rsquo;m very accepting. I&rsquo;m only a little bit curious. There&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re hesitant to share?</p><p>** She **</p><p>I love reclusive hideaways. Capri. The Bahamas.</p><p>** He **</p><p>Married? [no reply] Okay, I can live with that. [He talks now as if thinking out loud or talking to a third person] I&rsquo;m married, so she can be married too. It&rsquo;s just that I was thinking of myself as the more secure of the two of us. If she&rsquo;s married then she may be&mldr; a rock. She has her husband if this doesn&rsquo;t work out. I have my wife to fall back on that is, unless she was to find out I was cheating. Well, I&rsquo;m not exactly cheating - not yet. [He suddenly snaps into awareness of her.] Not that I&rsquo;m taking you for granted. I hope you realize that.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m a slender, toned, pretty widow.</p><p>** He **</p><p>Now we&rsquo;re talking! That&rsquo;s going where we need to go. A widow! Why didn&rsquo;t you say so? That&rsquo;s great! Fine! [Suddenly somber] Not that I&rsquo;m not sorry to hear the news. I&rsquo;ve the greatest of respect for him. Dan? Edward? Arnold? You don&rsquo;t need to tell me. I understand. It may be too soon. It may hurt too much - open a wound.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m slender, extremely attractive, with beautiful eyes.</p><p>** He **</p><p>Yes, yes. Beautiful eyes. Blue I would say. Blue gray? Hazel? Not green. Beautiful anyway.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I evidence lively appreciation and have a healthy sense of humor.</p><p>** He **</p><p>[Feigning hilarity] Oh yeah! That&rsquo;s what I wanted to hear. Love a sense of humor.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m Pilates toned, Tuscan cooking trained.</p><p>** He **: Pilates! Great! Terrific gismo. Really gets you like no other device. Stretches those hamstrings, eh? You&rsquo;re a well rounded person.</p><p>She: I&rsquo;ve got a knockout figure.</p><p>** He **</p><p>Hmm. This is a subject I thought we might get to, but not right away. I don&rsquo;t sleep around, you know. I&rsquo;ve been AIDS tested. Negative. Not presuming anything about intimacy. Take our time, right? No hurry: all the time in the world. If it happens, it happens.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I enjoy the finer things without hedging toward materialism.</p><p>** He **</p><p>Wait a sec. No implication of materialism here. Not at all. You might want a little something now and then: perfume, a negligee, a scarf. Not a bribe or a pay-off. To know I care, right? That I appreciate who you are.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I actively enjoy hiking.</p><p>** He **</p><p>[shaking his head in disbelief] Hiking is cool. Very cool. Yep, hiking, So where are we at?</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m humbled but not entirely defeated, by the language of writing for personal ads.</p><p>** He **</p><p>Gee. You wouldn&rsquo;t know it talking to you. You seem to have the language down pretty good. Pretty well. You express yourself most&mldr; elecutionarily.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m expressive, with passionate eyes and legs that don&rsquo;t stop.</p><p>** He **</p><p>I can&rsquo;t see your legs - under the table. I&rsquo;d like to, of course. I take your word for it, though. Maybe we could leave this place, if that isn&rsquo;t taking you for granted. I don&rsquo;t mean go to a hotel room. A place that&rsquo;s a little more intimate.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m out of the closet about loving country music. [She smiles weakly.]</p><p>** He **</p><p>Hey, you&rsquo;ve got quite the smile. Love it when you smile.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I enjoy hiking, cooking and yoga.</p><p>** He **</p><p>You&rsquo;re kidding. [She looks blank.] No, you&rsquo;re not pulling my leg. But you said exactly the same thing - hiking, cooking and yoga - before. Not that I don&rsquo;t approve. You go ahead and talk the way you wish. I&rsquo;m accepting. Yesirree. You go right ahead. Non judgmental here, very non judgmental.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I enjoy hiking, cross country skiing, dinner in cozy restaurants.</p><p>** He **</p><p>[condescendenly] Uh huh. Well I do too. Never pass up an opportunity for [adopts a cadence] hiking, cross country skiing or dinners in cozy restaurants. But, my wife, you see I do love her and don&rsquo;t want to do anything to hurt her.</p><p>** She **</p><p>Art, tennis, sailing.</p><p>** He **</p><p>And maybe this-us, actually doing something - might indirectly hurt her. She might&mldr; they say a spouse can sense the infidelity in the air, pick it up from the face or the kiss hello. So, maybe&mldr;.</p><p>** She **</p><p>[interrupting] I&rsquo;m sparking, bold, international.</p><p>** He **</p><p>You are; you are. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand. It&rsquo;s nothing about you. In not getting cold feet. You&rsquo;re terrific. Matter of fact, I&rsquo;m turned on - could sweep you right off your feet - if you don&rsquo;t mind the phrase It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve had a chance to <em>think.</em> And I&rsquo;m thinking maybe I&rsquo;m not mature enough for this. At least, not yet. For you. You being a widow, having grieved, and matured; I&rsquo;m sure.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m tall, slender, graceful.</p><p>** He **</p><p>And self confident. Yes, you are. Very direct about your strengths. I like that.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m glad you like that.</p><p>** He **</p><p>[stunned] Yeah! Forgive me; I&rsquo;m just taken aback - by your speech.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I like a man who admires me.</p><p>** He **</p><p>Really! I&rsquo;m a Stephen Hawkings think-alike, play jazz piano, have a high I.Q.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m eager to get to know you.</p><p>** He **</p><p>I&rsquo;m seeking an adventurous and empathic, fit, SWF tech writing for companionship or commitment.</p><p>** She **</p><p>You&rsquo;re cute.</p><p>** He **</p><p>I adore browsing, cooking shops, people watching, art openings.</p><p>** She **</p><p>Me too.</p><p>** He **</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been mistaken for John Barrymore</p><p>** She **</p><p>Let&rsquo;s go someplace more intimate.</p><p>** He **</p><p>Except that I must be off. Didn&rsquo;t realize how late. Time goes by. Know that song? [He hums the refrain from As Time Goes By] It&rsquo;s not a case of cold feet, nah uh. You&rsquo;re everything you say you are. And more. More and more. But I must run. Not <em>run.</em> Walk. I must go. Wife, you know, told her I&rsquo;d be back by [He looks at his watch.] six o&rsquo;clock. Yep. It&rsquo;s been real. A real pleasure.</p><p>** She **</p><p>You&rsquo;re unfussy, clever, engagingly self-deprecating.</p><p>** He **</p><p>Funny. I was going to say the same about you. Same to you.</p><p>** She **</p><p>I&rsquo;m toned, addicted to Pilates&mldr;</p><p>** He **</p><p>Not actually addicted. You just appreciate Pilates the way any intelligent person would.</p><p>** She **</p><p>You&rsquo;re perceptive.</p><p>** He **</p><p>[getting up] Great to meet you. We&rsquo;ll be in touch, all right? Real soon. I have your e-mail. Terrific. [Rushes off].</p><p>** She **</p><p>He has a passion for the outdoors.</p></div><nav class="mt-5 pt-4 border-top"><div class="d-flex justify-content-between gap-3"><div><a href=https://mreider.com/family/pete-reider/aunt-ethel/ class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary">← Previous: Aunt Ethel</a></div><div><a href=https://mreider.com/family/pete-reider/an-exodus/ class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary">Next: An Exodus →</a></div></div></nav><footer class="text-center mt-5">Generated with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></footer></div></div><script src=/js/bootstrap.js></script></body></html>
