My work is sourced from photographs taken by me and my partner (both film photographers) of our lives together.&lt;/p&gt;

She lives in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://mreider.com/images/deb/deb.jpg" alt="deborah"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deb wrote a One Boy about raising her son, Caleb (my cousin), after the passing of her husband and Caleb&amp;rsquo;s father. This is the illustration on the front cover that Caleb created when he was a young boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what she wrote on the back cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consult about and edit early stages of books, as a developmental editor. I did this for faculty at the University of Washington Medical School, and other books, including Aaron Dixon&amp;rsquo;s account of his experience as a leader with the Black Panther Party, and a book by Jerry Mander of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Janet Reider</title><link>https://mreider.com/family/janet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mreider.com/family/janet/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Digital has replaced film. The Hasselblad snoozes on a closet shelf. I am more apt to capture aspects of people - young mothers in rapt conversation while their children argue over a plastic toy, the focused energy of men on a park bench talking politics and dedication of a sunbather on a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
