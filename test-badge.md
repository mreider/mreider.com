Here are different ways to use the badge styles:

## Inside Links (Original Design)
<a href="/tags/active/" class="tag-link"><span class="tag-badge">Active</span></a>
<a href="/tags/inactive/" class="tag-link"><span class="tag-badge-simple">Inactive</span></a>

## Standalone Badges (Should Work Too)
<span class="tag-badge">Gradient Badge</span>
<span class="tag-badge-simple">Simple Badge</span>

## Mixed Usage
Status: <span class="tag-badge-simple">Active</span> | Priority: <span class="tag-badge">High</span>

The standalone badges should look the same as the linked ones, just without the hover effects and link behavior.
