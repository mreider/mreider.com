      <title>Why AI won&#39;t take control</title>
      <link>https://mreider.com/tech/ai-hype/</link>

      <description>AI went from a niche tech topic to a mainstream obsession in just the last 24 months. Unlike other hyped technologies that promised future revolutions, AI delivers immediate value anyone can experience. People can jump onto ChatGPT and use it to write a poem, draft an email, or provide information that previously required a Google search. This immediate utility has transformed AI from industry jargon into a household term.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s clarify what we&amp;rsquo;re discussing: Autonomous AI operates independently without human oversight.</description>

      <title>LinkedIn, Geopolitics, and Silence</title>
      <link>https://mreider.com/tech/linked-in-refuge/</link>

      <description>Note: I no longer believe that LinkedIn should be a refuge from political news, as I said in the post the following week.&#xA;My office in the Dynatrace Vienna Tower shares space with various companies and organizations, including the embassies of Norway, Australia, and New Zealand. Today, these three embassies organized a brief moment of silence outside our building to honor those who have suffered and lost their lives as a result of the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine.</description>

      <title>Email Subscriptions from Static Blogs</title>
      <link>https://mreider.com/tech/email-subscriptions-from-static-blogs/</link>

      <description>In my last blog entry, I introduced Krems, a project I built for generating static blogs. One of the challenges with static blogs is their inability to run server-side code or databases, which makes storing email addresses for blog subscriptions impossible. To work around this, you can either use a paid service like rssfeedpulse.com to scrape your RSS feed and email new posts to subscribers, or you can encourage readers to follow your blog using an RSS reader.</description>

      <title>Krems static blog generator</title>

      <description>A couple of months ago we visited a little town named Krems about an hour West of Vienna. In that little town is a University where my son would apply, though now that he&amp;rsquo;s been accepted to a few schools in Scotland he likely won&amp;rsquo;t attend. After we returned to Vienna I thought about writing a short blog about our visit there, but to my horror my blog was no longer loading properly.</description>

      <title>Sudowrite, ChatGPT, and AI Slop</title>
      <link>https://mreider.com/tech/sudowrite-chatgpt-and-ai-slop/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write a novel - a character-driven thriller. I use ChatGPT here and there, but I try to use it lightly. It&amp;rsquo;s a time-saver for small changes and touch-ups.&#xA;However, ChatGPT is too general-purpose for writers and often resorts to &amp;ldquo;corporate-speak.&amp;rdquo; This led me to try Sudowrite, which is built on language models like GPT but designed for aspiring authors.&#xA;Sudowrite blends AI with structured writing tools and an interface similar to Scrivener.</description>

      <title>Great Strategy Starts with Sacrifice</title>
      <link>https://mreider.com/tech/trade-off-as-strategy/</link>

      <description>Before I get started, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why I&amp;rsquo;m blogging. I began offering pro-bono product advice, hoping to charge a fee someday. Balancing a full-time job, family, and personal interests didn&amp;rsquo;t work out well. What did work out was writing about other people&amp;rsquo;s challenges. It&amp;rsquo;s freeing since the problems aren&amp;rsquo;t tied to my workplace.&#xA;Today I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about the importance of sacrifice in product strategy.&#xA;In 2017, a young CEO I worked for explained that certain features would open up a new market segment.</description>

      <title>Bluesky is almost like 2012 Twitter</title>
      <link>https://mreider.com/tech/blue-sky/</link>

      <description>Bluesky is going ok so far. I don&amp;rsquo;t have many followers yet, and I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out who to follow, but it&amp;rsquo;s the closest thing we&amp;rsquo;ve had in years to 2012 Twitter. The one where tech folks could have fun, feel connected, and not drown in nonsense.&#xA;Back then we wondered how Twitter would make money. Bluesky is in the same place. But unlike Twitter, which grew organically from a quirky SMS tool, Bluesky isn&amp;rsquo;t organic.</description>

      <title>Certainty, Ambivalence, and Product Leadership</title>
      <link>https://mreider.com/tech/on-ambivalence/</link>

      <description>Every night at 9:00 PM, I walk my dog, Leo, while listening to podcasts. I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to Hidden Brain with Shankar Vedantam. In a recent episode, Naomi Rothman talked about how society values leaders who project certainty over ambivalence - often favoring confidence even when it&amp;rsquo;s based on incomplete or inaccurate information.&#xA;Rothman cited a study where CEOs who admitted uncertainty during earnings calls were judged more harshly and seen as less competent, even though they were being honest.</description>

      <title>Doing It for Yourself</title>
      <link>https://mreider.com/tech/doing-it-for-yourself/</link>

      <description>I recently had a conversation with a product manager from another company that left me thinking. Every time he referred to an initiative, he called it &amp;ldquo;mine.&amp;rdquo; Deadlines and priorities were framed as &amp;ldquo;important for me&amp;rdquo; - not for the team, not for the users, but for himself.&#xA;On one level, this is human nature. We all bring some degree of self-interest to the work we do. But when a product manager frames everything this way, it stops feeling like a team effort and starts looking like a personal project tied to their ego.</description>

      <title>VMware, Pivotal, and the Rise of Kubernetes</title>
      <link>https://mreider.com/tech/pivotal-and-the-rise-of-cloud-foundry/</link>

      <description>When I left Engine Yard (see my earlier post), I joined VMware to work on the Cloud Foundry team. The idea was ambitious: create a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that allowed developers to write and deploy applications without worrying about infrastructure. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t revolutionary. Heroku and Engine Yard had similar goals, but it offered something enterprises hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before.&#xA;The secret weapon was BOSH, a powerful orchestration tool that deployed Cloud Foundry on private or public clouds in a declarative, repeatable way.</description>

      <title>Building Quacker: A Weekend Project with ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://mreider.com/tech/building-quacker/</link>

      <description>Last weekend, I built Quacker, a Python app that lets static blogs send newsletters. Static blogs are simple, fast, and reliable - but they don&amp;rsquo;t have built-in features like email subscriptions or post notifications. I could&amp;rsquo;ve used something like Ghost, but I spent the weekend reinventing the wheel.&#xA;Quacker does what I need: it adds a subscription form to my blog, stores emails, checks the RSS feed for updates, and sends subscribers an email when there&amp;rsquo;s a new post.</description>

      <title>Founders Don’t Need a Strategist as the First PM</title>

      <description>I recently spoke with the CEO of a small, profitable startup. Let&amp;rsquo;s call him Mike. His company pulls in a few million dollars a year with a lean team. They&amp;rsquo;ve made it past the survival stage, but now they&amp;rsquo;re grappling with the next big question: how to grow.&#xA;Mike&amp;rsquo;s team is stuck on a familiar startup dilemma: which user to prioritize. Mike wants to focus on buyers, adding features like loyalty programs, promotions, and customer acquisition tools.</description>

      <title>Engine Yard and the Cost of Venture Capital</title>
      <link>https://mreider.com/tech/tales-from-engineyard/</link>

      <description>Back in the early days of cloud computing, before &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; meant what it does today, we were one of the original cloud vendors. Our infrastructure ran on custom-patched Gentoo servers, nicknamed &amp;ldquo;pizza boxes,&amp;rdquo; housed in two data centers on opposite coasts. Scaling wasn&amp;rsquo;t automated. It was manual, requiring real humans to intervene. As our head of support jokingly put it, we were a &amp;ldquo;meat cloud.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Still, we were ahead of the curve, offering a platform as a service (PaaS) for Ruby on Rails apps, MongoDB, and MySQL databases.</description>
