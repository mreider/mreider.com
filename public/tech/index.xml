      <title>Why AI won&#39;t take control</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/tech/ai-hype/</link>

      <description>AI went from a niche tech topic to a mainstream obsession in just the last 24 months. Unlike other hyped technologies that promised future revolutions, AI delivers immediate value anyone can experience. People can jump onto ChatGPT and be dazzled by its ability to write a poem, draft an email, or provide information that previously required a Google search. This immediate, almost magical utility has transformed AI from industry jargon into a household term.</description>

      <title>Email Subscriptions from Static Blogs</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/tech/email-subscriptions-from-static-blogs/</link>

      <description>In my last blog entry, I introduced Krems, a project I built for generating static blogs. One of the challenges with static blogs is their inability to run server-side code or databases, which makes storing email addresses for blog subscriptions impossible. To work around this, you can either use a paid service like rssfeedpulse.com to scrape your RSS feed and email new posts to subscribers, or you can encourage readers to follow your blog using an RSS reader.</description>

      <title>Krems static blog generator</title>

      <description>A couple of months ago we visited a little town named Krems about an hour West of Vienna. In that little town is a University where my son would apply, though now that he’s been accepted to a few schools in Scotland he likely won’t attend. After we returned to Vienna I thought about writing a short blog about our visit there, but to my horror my blog was nolonger loading properly.</description>

      <title>Sudowrite, ChatGPT, and AI Slop</title>

      <description>Like a million other people, I’m trying to write a novel—a character-driven thriller. We’ll see how far I get. Admittedly, I use ChatGPT here and there, but I try to use it lightly. it’s a time-saver for small changes and touch-ups.&#xA;However, ChatGPT is too general-purpose for writers and often resorts to “corporate-speak,” even after you scold it. This led me to try Sudowrite, which is built on language models like GPT but devoted to and designed for aspiring authors.</description>

      <title>Great Strategy Starts with Sacrifice</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/tech/trade-off-as-strategy/</link>

      <description>Before I get started, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why I’m blogging. I began offering pro-bono product advice, hoping to charge a fee someday. While I had some success, balancing a full-time job, family, and personal interests didn&amp;rsquo;t work out well. What did work out was writing about other people’s challenges. I like it. And, it&amp;rsquo;s freeing since the problems aren’t tied to my workplace.&#xA;Today I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about the importance of sacrifice in product strategy.</description>

      <title>Bluesky is almost like 2012 Twitter</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/tech/blue-sky/</link>

      <description>Bluesky is going ok so far. I don’t have many followers yet, and I’m still figuring out who to follow, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had in years to 2012 Twitter—the good Twitter. The one where tech folks could have fun, feel connected, and not drown in nonsense.&#xA;Back then we wondered how Twitter would make money. Bluesky is in the same place. But unlike Twitter, which grew organically from a quirky SMS tool, Bluesky isn’t organic.</description>

      <title>VMware, Pivotal, and the Rise of Kubernetes</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/tech/pivotal-and-the-rise-of-cloud-foundry/</link>

      <description>When I left Engine Yard (see my earlier post), I joined VMware to work on the Cloud Foundry team. The idea was ambitious: create a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that allowed developers to write and deploy applications without worrying about infrastructure. It wasn’t revolutionary—Heroku and Engine Yard had similar goals—but it offered something enterprises hadn’t seen before.&#xA;The secret weapon was BOSH, a powerful orchestration tool that deployed Cloud Foundry on private or public clouds in a declarative, repeatable way.</description>

      <title>Building Quacker: A Weekend Project with ChatGPT</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/tech/building-quacker/</link>

      <description>Last weekend, I built Quacker, a Python app that lets static blogs send newsletters. Static blogs are great—simple, fast, and reliable—but they don’t have built-in features like email subscriptions or post notifications. I could’ve used something like Ghost, but instead, I spent the weekend reinventing the wheel. Maybe not the smartest choice.&#xA;Quacker does what I need: it adds a subscription form to my blog, stores emails, checks the RSS feed for updates, and sends subscribers an email when there’s a new post.</description>

      <title>Engine Yard and the Cost of Venture Capital</title>

      <description>Back in the early days of cloud computing, before &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; meant what it does today, we were one of the original cloud vendors. Our infrastructure ran on custom-patched Gentoo servers—nicknamed &amp;ldquo;pizza boxes&amp;rdquo;—housed in two data centers on opposite coasts. Scaling wasn’t automated. It was manual, requiring real humans to intervene. As our head of support jokingly put it, we were a &amp;ldquo;meat cloud.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Still, we were ahead of the curve, offering a platform as a service (PaaS) for Ruby on Rails apps, MongoDB, and MySQL databases.</description>
