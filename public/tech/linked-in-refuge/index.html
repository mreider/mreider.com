        <p>Note: I no longer believe that LinkedIn should be a refuge from political news, as I said in the post the <a href="more_zelinskiy.md">following week</a>.</p>
<p>My office in the Dynatrace Vienna Tower shares space with various companies and organizations, including the embassies of Norway, Australia, and New Zealand. Today, these three embassies organized a brief moment of silence outside our building to honor those who have suffered and lost their lives as a result of the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine. I took the elevator downstairs, stepped outside, and joined everyone in that quiet reflection.</p>
<p>The moment of silence felt good after a few nights of doom-scrolling on my phone. Like many, I go through phases of being consumed by the news cycle. I check Reddit, BlueSky, and Mastodon, read depressing updates about the state of the planet, and end up feeling helpless and alone. Eventually, I resist the temptation and turn to a good book. The pattern repeats - feeling compelled to check the news, only to realize it does nothing for my peace of mind.</p>
<p>One app that doesn&rsquo;t depress me is LinkedIn. My feed is limited to updates about observability, artificial intelligence, updates from friends, colleagues, and people who take themselves too seriously - which is annoying but not depressing. LinkedIn is a refuge from geopolitical news.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also weird. My LinkedIn feed is disconnected from what&rsquo;s happening just beyond the gates. It&rsquo;s like that dog drinking coffee, saying everything is fine. I often catch myself on LinkedIn, responding to some post about Kubernetes, then stopping and thinking, What the hell are we all doing here?</p>
<p>As George Orwell said, &ldquo;In our age, there is no such thing as &lsquo;keeping out of politics.&rsquo;&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure what he&rsquo;d make of LinkedIn. But I prefer it this way - I think we all do. Software and tech are as much of an escape as the book I&rsquo;m reading (Lonesome Dove). I&rsquo;m not sure if these boundaries will hold - or if they should.</p>
