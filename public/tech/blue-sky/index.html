        <p>Bluesky is going ok so far. I don&rsquo;t have many followers yet, and I&rsquo;m still figuring out who to follow, but it&rsquo;s the closest thing we&rsquo;ve had in years to 2012 Twitter. The one where tech folks could have fun, feel connected, and not drown in nonsense.</p>
<p>Back then we wondered how Twitter would make money. Bluesky is in the same place. But unlike Twitter, which grew organically from a quirky SMS tool, Bluesky isn&rsquo;t organic. It has a clearer sense of what it wants to be.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="where-is-bluesky-going">Where is Bluesky going?</h2>
<p>Bluesky is algorithm-free. Your timeline is chronological, showing posts in order rather than prioritizing engagement. There&rsquo;s no advertising. For now, you&rsquo;re not the product.</p>
<p>Early Twitter was like this. It hadn&rsquo;t yet followed the Zuckerberg model of monetizing eyeballs via algorithmic engagement.</p>
<p>Bluesky&rsquo;s identity is tied to the AT Protocol, reminiscent of the crypto industry&rsquo;s obsession with protocols. This likely stems from Bluesky&rsquo;s roots, as many of its owners have connections to the protocol-driven crypto world. Co-owner Mike Masnick captures this idea in an article on <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech">protocols vs platforms</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In the last few years, with the development of cryptocurrencies and tokens, it has become theoretically possible to build a protocol that uses a cryptocurrency or a token that has some value attached to it, with the value of those items growing in conjunction with usage. A simple way of looking at this is that a token-based cryptocurrency is the equivalent of equity in a company, but rather than the value being tied to the financial success of the company, the value of a crypto token is tied to the value of the overall network.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This focus on the AT Protocol gives Bluesky a way to market itself as a distributed network, much like the ideals Masnick outlines in his article on protocols over platforms. But in reality, that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening. Everyone is on bluesky.social, and its growth has nothing to do with decentralization or the protocol. It functions like a centralized platform.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-will-they-monetize">How Will They Monetize?</h2>
<p>Last week, a mockup of a leaked Bluesky membership page popped up. Even if real, charging fees might cover a few weeks of cloud costs, but it won&rsquo;t be enough to fund a growing platform long-term.</p>
<p><img src="/images/matt/bluesky-mockup.png" alt="mockup"></p>
<p>So, what happens next? How do they monetize this thing? They&rsquo;ll likely keep growing bluesky.social, putting off the monetization question until it can&rsquo;t be avoided.</p>
<p>At some point this leaves two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Advertising:</strong> Eventually, they might introduce ads - maybe just on bluesky.social - while claiming users could move to other AT Protocol servers if they don&rsquo;t like it. But no viable alternatives would exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Given Bluesky&rsquo;s crypto-heavy DNA, they might explore tokenizing the platform. Other companies have tried this - Reddit&rsquo;s NFT experiment fizzled, and Meta&rsquo;s &ldquo;Novi&rdquo; plans never got off the ground - but this is familiar territory for Bluesky&rsquo;s founders and backers. Tokenizing could offer incentives for users to create their own servers, with the value of the token increasing as the network grows - provided the token can be exchanged like other cryptocurrencies on platforms like Coinbase. This side of the tech industry puts speculation over substance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For now, Bluesky feels fun and like a community for tech folks. It&rsquo;s got the early Twitter vibe, complete with an uncertain future.</p>
