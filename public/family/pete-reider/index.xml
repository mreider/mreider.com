      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This obituary was originally published in the San Francisco Chronicle and Legacy.com, but I&amp;rsquo;ve put it here for posterity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mreider.com/images/dad/Reider20150823_20150822.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Pete Reider&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;arthur-elliott-pete-reider&#34;&gt;Arthur Elliott (Pete) Reider&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 1, 1936 - August 13th, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arthur Elliott (Pete) Reider, MD, died peacefully at home in San Francisco of lymphoma on Thursday August 13th 2015. He was 78, born in November of 1936. Janet Sampson Reider, his wife of 57 years, and all three of his children were by his side. Dr. Reider and Janet divided their time for the last few years between their family home in Newton, a home in Vermont and San Francisco where they grew up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An elderly Asian servant sweeps the doorstep proteceted by a surgical mask.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not a particle of the past transcends the warp of that shallow chalice tipped up to the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cement for these houses was poureed about 1930.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nothing substantial - no wine - no wafer - crosses the lip of 83 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; no getting ourselves back to the garden.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is just the sound of Joni Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The sun bouncing off the windows downtown keeps getting more and more golden. It is sundown and the houses below-looking down Lake Street-are darkening fast. But the day doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to give up. The light from the west leaps across the hollow beneath me and catches the windows of the buildings on the hills to the east. Now it&amp;rsquo;s fading just like I knew it would a few moments ago. But it was good while it lasted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>One Hundred and Four</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My father, who would have been 104 on July 3, 2011, was a great guy- little impatient and a bit on the frugal side-but a terrific guy. He liked to keep words economical. In an anglophile fever pitch his immigrant Jewish parents named him Norman. He changed that to Norm, then to Nor, shortened that to No and finally decided to be called &lt;em&gt;Nnnnn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His impatience was not completely unprovoked. My mother (Louise) dawdled whenever they went walking. She paused to examine the sequins on the store window dress. She paused to read the notices to the public on telephone poles. In the country she examined the veins of leaves. &amp;ldquo;Jeez LouEEz.&amp;rdquo; Nnnnn said each time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOLORES&lt;/strong&gt; 35, a swimmer at the Puritan Health Club.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHILIP&lt;/strong&gt; 44, also a swimmer at the Puritan Health Club.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MR. BOUSH&lt;/strong&gt; (BOOsh) 56, the owner and manager of the Puritan Health Club.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ELANA&lt;/strong&gt; 21, MR. BOUCH&amp;rsquo;s assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCENE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A garishly furnished office in downtown Boston. It is dominated by a huge desk behind which sits Mr. Boush smoking a large cigar. He is hefty and wears his dark hair slicked back. We can see his white and blue striped shirt and wide white tie above the desk. His weightlifter shoulders stretch the seams of his shirt. In front of the desk Dolores and Philip each stand next to overstuffed leather chairs that face one another. Dolores wears tight-fitting blue jeans and a white blouse unbuttoned to expose mammaries spilling over a black bra. Her blond hair is partially wet and appears hastily combed back accentuating her narrow face and long nose. Philip is short, bald and flabby. He is naked except for a towel around his middle. We hear Frank Sinatra singing, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s quarter to three/There&amp;rsquo;s no one in the place except you and me/So set &amp;rsquo;em up Joell&amp;rsquo;ve got a little story you ought to know/Were drinkin&amp;rsquo; my friend, to the end of a brief episode/Make it one for my baby and one more for the road&amp;rdquo; as the lights go on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Barbara knocked on the frame of the open door. A woman in green track suit answered, &amp;ldquo;Whadya want?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is this the Bernfield residence?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; She paused. She was smoking a cigarette. No filter. Her iridescent green track suit had seen better days. &amp;ldquo;This is the Bernstein residence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh,&amp;rdquo; said Barbara, trying to sound upbeat, as if she had heard good news. &amp;ldquo;Well, I thought it was the Bernfield residence&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not,&amp;rdquo; said Mrs. Bernstein.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today is Max&amp;rsquo;s birthday. He&amp;rsquo;s three. Max has a sister-Zoe. She&amp;rsquo;s not so old. Zoe is about one and a half. They live on a steep hill with trees in Oakland, California. Max likes to do stuff on his own and in his own way. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t like it when people pet his hair. His hair is light brown and arranges itself in a curve like a lovable sleeping kitten. He&amp;rsquo;s polite but moves off when people fuss with it. Max says, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to be a big guy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Exodus</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The chilling northeasterly wind hit me full in the face as I came out of Gosman. I buttoned my Navy P jacket - a souvenir of World War II - thinking what amazing warmth that single layer of wool afforded. I had just come from Carol Shedd&amp;rsquo;s class on The Old Testament. While sitting there, immersed in reading to myself, the ancient words from Exodus had jumped out at me across time: &lt;em&gt;If thou at all take thy neighbor&amp;rsquo;s garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin; wherein shall he sleep?&lt;/em&gt; Here I was at eighty four getting an education - late, but perhaps not too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;** He **&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a little uptight about this - I guess I mean more than a little [forcing a laugh] because I don&amp;rsquo;t do this [a briefer nervous laugh] all the time. Well, no one does this really all the time. It&amp;rsquo;s just that&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing.

      <title>Aunt Ethel</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scarcely had I caught my breath after the second grade in Lebanon, Missouri, when I was face to face with an entirely new cast of characters in a totally new venue, New York City. Queen of the players on dazzling stage was a willowy woman with weightless flaxen hair who moved in sudden nervous starts but once in motion floated effortlessly, creating for me the image of a grand, highly visible, Tinker Bell. Driving in our 1939 Plymouth from Missouri to New York, my mother prepared me for Great Aunt Ethel in exalted prose; yet, in her own person, she was stunningly greater than my imagination&amp;rsquo;s best productions. She spoke with a soft crooning voice, accenting syllables in a novel way, so that I often grasped the word only after a delay. Oh, she meant decent when she said &lt;em&gt;desant&lt;/em&gt;. The word game added to the numerous pleasures of listening to her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Kitchen Virus</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the West Nile virus came the Kitchen virus. My wife&amp;rsquo;s friend, Myrna Slotkin, got it first. Then it spread to Vera Popovsky. Soon it infected the eleven other members of her Wednesday morning book club. Convoys of trucks delivering colossal metal stoves and gigantic refrigerators - all of them stainless steel (colors are out) - converged on suburban Newton creating massive potholes the blame for which fell upon the mayor, nearly costing him reelection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ferdinand Blumer in his 82nd year was a believer in life&amp;rsquo;s small pleasures. His admiration for his late wife, Margarite, had been huge. Warm and gregarious, she created comfort with people wherever they went - making up for his lifelong shyness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One day in an adventurous mood he went out into his back yard. He was intent on attracting a particular bird whose call he had memorized precisely but who remained aloof to his overtures. He waited for a lull in the breeze - nothing to disturb his plaintive song and let it go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Grandmother</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just before the sign pointing to the beach I turned away from the tar topped road onto the sand in the salt marsh. The tide was out. The sinuous sandy trail soon led around a dune banked with thatch - still wet - and wisps of green plants holding on mightily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought I was all alone but as I rounded the turn my grandmother, Rena, was running. It amazed me how her short squat body, her thin legs coming out from her ballooning black silken running shorts, could move so well, so tirelessly as her feet sunk into the bottom of the wet sandy estuary. I was running only slightly faster. I wanted to call out, but how would she recognize me. I last saw her forty-eight years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
