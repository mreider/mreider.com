        <p>Ferdinand Blumer in his 82nd year was a believer in life&rsquo;s small pleasures. His admiration for his late wife, Margarite, had been huge. Warm and gregarious, she created comfort with people wherever they went - making up for his lifelong shyness.</p>
<p>One day in an adventurous mood he went out into his back yard. He was intent on attracting a particular bird whose call he had memorized precisely but who remained aloof to his overtures. He waited for a lull in the breeze - nothing to disturb his plaintive song and let it go.</p>
<p>There was a pause and then he heard it. The same call exactly, answering back. She was somewhere in the trees and bushes to the side. He called out again. Again, after a slight latency, the answer resounded. He tried to see where the creature might be but the summer foliage was too dense. Three more times he and hidden bird exchanged greetings.</p>
<p>Ferdinand was terribly excited. He wanted to call someone but was afraid the event might seem ludicrously tame for a telephone call. George! George would understand. George was a retiree of the same age - a good humored man who always had a positive word. And he lived right next door so the news would be appropriately neighborly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ferdinand,&rdquo; cried George as he opened the door. &ldquo;I was just coming over to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the most amazing experience. I was out in the yard and heard what I think was a nightingale. It was beautiful. I answered and it answered back - not once but many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ferdinand&rsquo;s mouth fell open. He was so amazed he was almost speechless. Recovering as quickly as possible he managed to gasp, &ldquo;But that is what I was going to say to you. I went out and called, and the same thing, several times it returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They burst out laughing then; Ferdinand was convulsed. It was the best joke in ten years. &ldquo;So you and I are nightingales,&rdquo; he managed between gasps and tears.</p>
<p>And when Ferdinand would lament, &ldquo;For whom am I alive?&rdquo; - asking in his self-effacing way for a friendly boost - George would remind him of his Franciscan gift.</p>
