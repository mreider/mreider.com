      <description>My inspiration comes from the many layers of my life and the people around me. My work is sourced from photographs taken by me and my partner (both film photographers) of our lives together.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more information about my work at charlottereidersmith.com.</description>

      <description>Deborah is my Aunt. She lives in Seattle.&#xA;Deb wrote a One Boy about raising her son, Caleb (my cousin), after the passing of her husband and Caleb&amp;rsquo;s father. This is the illustration on the front cover that Caleb created when he was a young boy.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s what she wrote on the back cover:&#xA;I consult about and edit early stages of books, as a developmental editor. I did this for faculty at the University of Washington Medical School, and other books, including Aaron Dixon&amp;rsquo;s account of his experience as a leader with the Black Panther Party, and a book by Jerry Mander of San Francisco.</description>

      <description>Digital has replaced film. The Hasselblad snoozes on a closet shelf. I am more apt to capture aspects of people — young mothers in rapt conversation while their children argue over a plastic toy, the focused energy of men on a park bench talking politics and dedication of a sunbather on a bridge.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more information about my work at janetreider.com.</description>
