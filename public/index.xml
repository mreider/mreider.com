      <description>Last night my wife invited me out to see The Fifth Step, a Scottish stage play that has been recorded for movie goers and streamers. It stars Jack Lowden, who I know from the show Slow Horses, and Martin Freeman who&amp;rsquo;s been in a bunch of stuff. My favorite role of his is the sociopathic weakling midwestern used car dealer Lester Nygaard in the TV series Fargo.&#xA;The play is done in-the-round, meaning the audience completely surrounds the stage, which in this case is actually a square.</description>

      <description>Leonard and Hungry Paul by Ronan Hession is a fun, dry, wholesome, and satisfying story about some normal people just sort of going through life together.&#xA;Early in the story we meet Leonard and Hungry Paul, two simple and straightforward men who schedule regular gaming nights to play things like Yahtzee, Monopoly, Connect Four, or checkers.&#xA;The storyline is about transition. Hungry Paul&amp;rsquo;s sister is getting married, which symbolizes her separation from her parents (whom Paul lives with), from Paul himself, and signals a new phase of all of their lives.</description>

      <description>The Good Whale is an engaging and emotional Serial podcast series about the 10+ year effort to reintroduce Keiko, the killer whale that starred in Free Willy, into the open ocean.&#xA;Each episode of The Good Whale reminded me of This American Life (no coincidence, as Ira Glass is one of the producers). The show tells a story by interviewing the people involved and reflecting on their conflicting views to show that there isn&amp;rsquo;t one way of looking at the story.</description>

      <title>Why AI won&#39;t take control</title>
      <link>https://mreider.com/tech/ai-hype/</link>

      <description>AI went from a niche tech topic to a mainstream obsession in just the last 24 months. Unlike other hyped technologies that promised future revolutions, AI delivers immediate value anyone can experience. People can jump onto ChatGPT and use it to write a poem, draft an email, or provide information that previously required a Google search. This immediate utility has transformed AI from industry jargon into a household term.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s clarify what we&amp;rsquo;re discussing: Autonomous AI operates independently without human oversight.</description>

      <description>Note: I no longer believe that LinkedIn should be a refuge from political news, as I said in the post the following week.&#xA;My office in the Dynatrace Vienna Tower shares space with various companies and organizations, including the embassies of Norway, Australia, and New Zealand. Today, these three embassies organized a brief moment of silence outside our building to honor those who have suffered and lost their lives as a result of the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine.</description>

      <title>Email Subscriptions from Static Blogs</title>

      <description>In my last blog entry, I introduced Krems, a project I built for generating static blogs. One of the challenges with static blogs is their inability to run server-side code or databases, which makes storing email addresses for blog subscriptions impossible. To work around this, you can either use a paid service like rssfeedpulse.com to scrape your RSS feed and email new posts to subscribers, or you can encourage readers to follow your blog using an RSS reader.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago we visited a little town named Krems about an hour West of Vienna. In that little town is a University where my son would apply, though now that he&amp;rsquo;s been accepted to a few schools in Scotland he likely won&amp;rsquo;t attend. After we returned to Vienna I thought about writing a short blog about our visit there, but to my horror my blog was no longer loading properly.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write a novel - a character-driven thriller. I use ChatGPT here and there, but I try to use it lightly. It&amp;rsquo;s a time-saver for small changes and touch-ups.&#xA;However, ChatGPT is too general-purpose for writers and often resorts to &amp;ldquo;corporate-speak.&amp;rdquo; This led me to try Sudowrite, which is built on language models like GPT but designed for aspiring authors.&#xA;Sudowrite blends AI with structured writing tools and an interface similar to Scrivener.</description>

      <description>Before I get started, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why I&amp;rsquo;m blogging. I began offering pro-bono product advice, hoping to charge a fee someday. Balancing a full-time job, family, and personal interests didn&amp;rsquo;t work out well. What did work out was writing about other people&amp;rsquo;s challenges. It&amp;rsquo;s freeing since the problems aren&amp;rsquo;t tied to my workplace.&#xA;Today I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about the importance of sacrifice in product strategy.&#xA;In 2017, a young CEO I worked for explained that certain features would open up a new market segment.</description>

      <title>Bluesky is almost like 2012 Twitter</title>

      <description>Bluesky is going ok so far. I don&amp;rsquo;t have many followers yet, and I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out who to follow, but it&amp;rsquo;s the closest thing we&amp;rsquo;ve had in years to 2012 Twitter. The one where tech folks could have fun, feel connected, and not drown in nonsense.&#xA;Back then we wondered how Twitter would make money. Bluesky is in the same place. But unlike Twitter, which grew organically from a quirky SMS tool, Bluesky isn&amp;rsquo;t organic.</description>

      <description>Every night at 9:00 PM, I walk my dog, Leo, while listening to podcasts. I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to Hidden Brain with Shankar Vedantam. In a recent episode, Naomi Rothman talked about how society values leaders who project certainty over ambivalence - often favoring confidence even when it&amp;rsquo;s based on incomplete or inaccurate information.&#xA;Rothman cited a study where CEOs who admitted uncertainty during earnings calls were judged more harshly and seen as less competent, even though they were being honest.</description>

      <description>I recently had a conversation with a product manager from another company that left me thinking. Every time he referred to an initiative, he called it &amp;ldquo;mine.&amp;rdquo; Deadlines and priorities were framed as &amp;ldquo;important for me&amp;rdquo; - not for the team, not for the users, but for himself.&#xA;On one level, this is human nature. We all bring some degree of self-interest to the work we do. But when a product manager frames everything this way, it stops feeling like a team effort and starts looking like a personal project tied to their ego.</description>

      <description>When I left Engine Yard (see my earlier post), I joined VMware to work on the Cloud Foundry team. The idea was ambitious: create a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that allowed developers to write and deploy applications without worrying about infrastructure. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t revolutionary. Heroku and Engine Yard had similar goals, but it offered something enterprises hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before.&#xA;The secret weapon was BOSH, a powerful orchestration tool that deployed Cloud Foundry on private or public clouds in a declarative, repeatable way.</description>

      <description>Last weekend, I built Quacker, a Python app that lets static blogs send newsletters. Static blogs are simple, fast, and reliable - but they don&amp;rsquo;t have built-in features like email subscriptions or post notifications. I could&amp;rsquo;ve used something like Ghost, but I spent the weekend reinventing the wheel.&#xA;Quacker does what I need: it adds a subscription form to my blog, stores emails, checks the RSS feed for updates, and sends subscribers an email when there&amp;rsquo;s a new post.</description>

They&amp;rsquo;ve made it past the survival stage, but now they&amp;rsquo;re grappling with the next big question: how to grow.&#xA;Mike&amp;rsquo;s team is stuck on a familiar startup dilemma: which user to prioritize. Mike wants to focus on buyers, adding features like loyalty programs, promotions, and customer acquisition tools.</description>

      <description>Back in the early days of cloud computing, before &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; meant what it does today, we were one of the original cloud vendors. Our infrastructure ran on custom-patched Gentoo servers, nicknamed &amp;ldquo;pizza boxes,&amp;rdquo; housed in two data centers on opposite coasts. Scaling wasn&amp;rsquo;t automated. It was manual, requiring real humans to intervene. As our head of support jokingly put it, we were a &amp;ldquo;meat cloud.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Still, we were ahead of the curve, offering a platform as a service (PaaS) for Ruby on Rails apps, MongoDB, and MySQL databases.</description>

      <description>Don’t you hate it when you do something stupid?&#xA;For my son Max, this happened two weeks ago when he left his gym bag on the 26 Strassbahn. He didn’t realize his mistake until hours later.&#xA;He asked if there was a Lost and Found for Wiener Linien, Vienna’s world-class transportation system. I browsed the web and found out about fundamt.gv.at, an incredible nationwide lost-and-found system. It’s an amazing site. Every single item is meticulously categorized.</description>

      <description>Today, I&amp;rsquo;m writing, again, about water.&#xA;Vienna’s water supply is famously clean. It comes straight from the Alps, requiring no treatment whatsoever. No chlorine, no filtration.&#xA;Yes, I read municipal water reports. Don’t judge.&#xA;Unfortunately, our house isn&amp;rsquo;t connected to the local water system. Instead, we rely on a well. Why? It&amp;rsquo;s a mystery, just one of the &amp;ldquo;charms&amp;rdquo; of our rental. The well water is fine for cooking and brushing teeth, but not for drinking.</description>

Finally, we wrapped things up in Portugal with the #friends4life Schwartzberg clan.&#xA;Coronavirus made things tricky. The guest list for Marty’s birthday ended up shorter than planned. Alison, an especially important guest, tested positive and spent the week feeling lousy at the Stony Brook Holiday Inn Express.</description>

So, we decided to drive north instead.&#xA;On the Road As with other vacations, this one began by dropping Leo (🐶) at his second home, a beautiful kennel ranch outside of Linz.&#xA;Nice place, right? Leo agrees. He waltzes in there with confidence, like the mayor of Dogville.</description>

We got a hyperactive dog named Leo. We visited friends and family in America, then went scuba diving in Costa Rica. In the autumn, we explored Belgium and climbed the Eiffel Tower. Winter came, and we traveled to Florence with my niece, sister, mom, and my mom&amp;rsquo;s husband.</description>

If you look closely, you’ll see Chris, the owner of Apollo Dive, sitting with my wife and kids.&#xA;Chris and his wife Maria led us on five dives in total.</description>

      <description>The Danube flows less than a mile from our house. One hot day, I biked there, took off my shirt, and jumped in. The current was strong, pulling me eastward toward Vienna. Thankfully, I made it back home in time for dinner.&#xA;A few weeks later, we drove to a bigger body of water, the Adriatic. Specifically, Venice, home to St. Mark&amp;rsquo;s corpse, Peggy Guggenheim&amp;rsquo;s dog cemetery, tagliatelle, and gondoliers. In Venice, it&amp;rsquo;s legal for a 14-year-old to operate a motorboat.</description>

You’re too excited.&#xA;Last fall, I bought a used bicycle for €170 from B7 Cycling Center, a shop that hires former inmates and trains them as mechanics.</description>

I can see when they&amp;rsquo;re at school, at home, or on a tram.&#xA;The current map looks like this:</description>

Fun was had by all: grown-up bunny-ear fun and kid fun on the Autodrom (bumper cars). But this wasn&amp;rsquo;t your ordinary Autodrom.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m on a work trip this week. Four of us are visiting a satellite office in Klagenfurt to meet the team and join some planning sessions. We took a five-hour train ride through the Alps. It was mostly dark and foggy, but whenever the fog lifted, I found myself comparing the countryside to places in America. The mountains look like the Rockies, big peaks and spires, but the grass and trees are a vivid, perfect green, just like Vermont.</description>

      <description>We’re ahead of ourselves. We want it to be April 2020, not September 2019. By April, the kids will take the tram on their own. They’ll have strong friendships. Alison and I will understand the healthcare system and know enough German to order a sandwich without having to point.&#xA;But it’s still September. We have to wait for the sun and moon to come and go 150 times.&#xA;I wish there were a magical way to fast-forward.</description>

      <description>Lots of rap lyrics mention benzos. Mercedes Benzos. Fancy cars. I just rented my second one from the Hertz in downtown Linz. It was a triple upgrade from a Ford Fiesta, but the rate stayed the same, just €32 a day. That&amp;rsquo;s how we roll. I rolled it all the way home.&#xA;We rent cars for hauling stuff we can&amp;rsquo;t carry and for getting out of town. Driving around Austria is pretty easy.</description>

      <description>I can’t understand a word these people are saying. But I do understand them on other levels.&#xA;They stack wood like it&amp;rsquo;s an art form. I&amp;rsquo;d probably do the same if I had wood to stack. Their toilets have a little shelf so they can examine their poop. I get it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been known to have similar interests. They&amp;rsquo;re highly attuned to mustard, my favorite condiment (and maybe even my favorite food).</description>

      <description>The basics are finally in place. The kids have beds and bed frames. We do too. Everyone has somewhere to put their clothes. There’s a dining room table now, along with some temporary folding chairs. Zoe has a desk in her room, and we’ve added some bedside tables.&#xA;The bathroom now houses a new washer and dryer, wedged snugly between the sink and the shower. They&amp;rsquo;re supposed to stack, but they don&amp;rsquo;t stack very well.</description>

      <description>We swapped our SIM cards for new ones from Hofer Telecom. Yes, Hofer is both a grocery store and a cell phone company. The plan costs $10 a month for 15 gigs of data and unlimited calls. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure which felt better, firing AT&amp;amp;T or Comcast. For reference, cable internet here is $39 a month for 100 gigabits.&#xA;Now we have these strange (to us) phone numbers that start with +43, the Austrian country code.</description>

Verklagen Sie mich (sue me)!&#xA;Tomorrow marks one week since we arrived in Linz, Austria. We’re living in an apartment on Spazenhofstraße, a quiet street along the Postlingberg Tram line. The building has five ground-level apartments, each with two floors, and five balcony apartments on the top level. The balcony apartment above us is occupied by Herig and Inga, who looked down from their balcony and waved as we arrived.</description>

      <description>An elderly Asian servant sweeps the doorstep proteceted by a surgical mask.&#xA;Not a particle of the past transcends the warp of that shallow chalice tipped up to the mouth.&#xA;The cement for these houses was poureed about 1930.&#xA;Nothing substantial - no wine - no wafer - crosses the lip of 83 years.&#xA;&amp;hellip; no getting ourselves back to the garden.&#xA;There is just the sound of Joni Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s voice.</description>

      <description>The sun bouncing off the windows downtown keeps getting more and more golden. It is sundown and the houses below-looking down Lake Street-are darkening fast. But the day doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to give up. The light from the west leaps across the hollow beneath me and catches the windows of the buildings on the hills to the east. Now it&amp;rsquo;s fading just like I knew it would a few moments ago. But it was good while it lasted.</description>

      <description>My father, who would have been 104 on July 3, 2011, was a great guy- little impatient and a bit on the frugal side-but a terrific guy. He liked to keep words economical. In an anglophile fever pitch his immigrant Jewish parents named him Norman. He changed that to Norm, then to Nor, shortened that to No and finally decided to be called Nnnnn.&#xA;His impatience was not completely unprovoked. My mother (Louise) dawdled whenever they went walking.</description>

A woman in green track suit answered, &amp;ldquo;Whadya want?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Is this the Bernfield residence?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; She paused. She was smoking a cigarette. No filter. Her iridescent green track suit had seen better days. &amp;ldquo;This is the Bernstein residence.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh,&amp;rdquo; said Barbara, trying to sound upbeat, as if she had heard good news. &amp;ldquo;Well, I thought it was the Bernfield residence&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not,&amp;rdquo; said Mrs.</description>

      <description>The chilling northeasterly wind hit me full in the face as I came out of Gosman. I buttoned my Navy P jacket - a souvenir of World War II - thinking what amazing warmth that single layer of wool afforded. I had just come from Carol Shedd&amp;rsquo;s class on The Old Testament. While sitting there, immersed in reading to myself, the ancient words from Exodus had jumped out at me across time: If thou at all take thy neighbor&amp;rsquo;s garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin; wherein shall he sleep?</description>

      <description>Scarcely had I caught my breath after the second grade in Lebanon, Missouri, when I was face to face with an entirely new cast of characters in a totally new venue, New York City. Queen of the players on dazzling stage was a willowy woman with weightless flaxen hair who moved in sudden nervous starts but once in motion floated effortlessly, creating for me the image of a grand, highly visible, Tinker Bell.</description>

      <description>After the West Nile virus came the Kitchen virus. My wife&amp;rsquo;s friend, Myrna Slotkin, got it first. Then it spread to Vera Popovsky. Soon it infected the eleven other members of her Wednesday morning book club. Convoys of trucks delivering colossal metal stoves and gigantic refrigerators - all of them stainless steel (colors are out) - converged on suburban Newton creating massive potholes the blame for which fell upon the mayor, nearly costing him reelection.</description>

      <description>Ferdinand Blumer in his 82nd year was a believer in life&amp;rsquo;s small pleasures. His admiration for his late wife, Margarite, had been huge. Warm and gregarious, she created comfort with people wherever they went - making up for his lifelong shyness.&#xA;One day in an adventurous mood he went out into his back yard. He was intent on attracting a particular bird whose call he had memorized precisely but who remained aloof to his overtures.</description>

      <description>Just before the sign pointing to the beach I turned away from the tar topped road onto the sand in the salt marsh. The tide was out. The sinuous sandy trail soon led around a dune banked with thatch - still wet - and wisps of green plants holding on mightily.&#xA;I thought I was all alone but as I rounded the turn my grandmother, Rena, was running. It amazed me how her short squat body, her thin legs coming out from her ballooning black silken running shorts, could move so well, so tirelessly as her feet sunk into the bottom of the wet sandy estuary.</description>

I did this for faculty at the University of Washington Medical School, and other books, including Aaron Dixon&amp;rsquo;s account of his experience as a leader with the Black Panther Party, and a book by Jerry Mander of San Francisco.</description>
