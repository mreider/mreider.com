            <p>Snow is falling in Linz today, which makes the kids very happy. I put on some ski gear and rode my bike to work—alongside dozens of other people doing the same.</p>
<p>The snow fits the scenery perfectly. Linz is fully decked out for Christmas. Lights are strung above the streets—clear lights, globes, stars, and multi-colored spirals.</p>
<p>Linz boasts three different Christmas markets within a half-mile radius. The market at Main Square has tasty Glühwein. Volksgarten features classical music, animatronic elves, and a Ferris wheel. Pfarrplatz even has a petting zoo.</p>
<p>Last weekend, we went to a Christmas gospel concert at the cathedral. The lead singer spoke fluent German, which the audience loved. He must have a connection to Austria—he’s been performing here every year for over a decade.</p>
<p><img src="/images/matt/image-7.png" alt="cathedral"></p>
<p>The next day, we attended a small party hosted by friends who are also from the Bay Area. I tried speaking a little German with their neighbors, but it wasn’t happening. We stuck to English.</p>
<h3 id="on-learning-german">On Learning German</h3>
<p>I expected Max and Zoe to pick up German faster than Alison and I would, but we’re all progressing at about the same pace. Almost every store, restaurant, movie theater, or office in Linz has some English, so intensive language training doesn’t feel essential.</p>
<p>At home, Alison and I practice German using an app called Duolingo. I also listen to a German podcast produced by an Irish guy who learns along with his listeners. Once a week, there’s a German class at my work, and Alison and I are both taking extracurricular classes. Mine starts Friday.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten comfortable with numbers, but calculating in German is tricky because the structure is reversed. Instead of saying “twenty-two,” you say “two and twenty.” That split second of translating in my head often causes me to miss whatever comes next.</p>
<p>Telling time is flipped too. 8:30 is “half nine,” not “half past eight.”</p>
<p>And then there are the articles. What a mess.</p>
<p>“The” is an article. French, Italian, and Spanish use gendered articles, so the form changes with the gender of the noun. For example, in Spanish: <em>el niño</em> (the boy, masculine) and <em>la niña</em> (the girl, feminine).</p>
<p>Like Spanish, German has masculine and feminine articles, but it also has a neutral article. <em>Der</em> (masculine), <em>die</em> (feminine), and <em>das</em> (neutral).</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Der Junge</em> (the boy, masculine).</li>
<li><em>Das Mädchen</em> (the girl, neutral).</li>
</ul>
<p>Wait—neutral? Yes, apparently neutral nouns often refer to diminutives, meaning small or cute things. But that rule isn’t consistent. For example, <em>die kleine Katze</em> (the little cat) is feminine. Why? No one knows. Kill me.</p>
<p>To make things even more confusing, the ending of a noun doesn’t always help. <em>Der Junge</em> ends in “e,” so you might think all nouns ending in “e” are masculine. Nope. <em>Die Katze</em> (feminine) ends in “e” too. You just have to memorize the article for each word.</p>
<p>And it gets worse. Articles change based on the noun’s role in the sentence. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Der Hund</em> (the dog, masculine) when it’s the subject.</li>
<li><em>Den Hund</em> (the dog, masculine) when it’s the direct object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possessive articles are another layer of fun. Can’t wait to tackle those.</p>
<p>Then there’s sentence structure. German loves to put the second verb at the very end of the sentence. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I would like you and your wife to join us for dinner next week” translates to:<br>
“I want you and your wife next week dinner with us join.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s like a slow reveal. You know it’s about dinner, but the action isn’t clear until the very last word. Eat dinner? Cook dinner? Regurgitate dinner? Oh—join! You want us to <em>join</em> you for dinner. Sorry, we can’t.</p>
<p>For now, the slow reveal isn’t too overwhelming because our vocabulary is still limited. But as we learn more words, I imagine it’ll feel like the flipped numbers—a brief pause to figure things out, and the rest of the sentence is lost.</p>
<p>The word for “repeat” is <em>wiederholen</em>. It feels appropriate.</p>
<p>To summarize: Christmas is here. German is hard. :)</p>
<p>Time to sign off and earn my daily Duolingo points before bed.</p>
<p><em>Gute Nacht!</em></p>
