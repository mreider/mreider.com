    <div class="post-content">
        <p>We’re ahead of ourselves. We want it to be April 2020, not September 2019. By April, the kids will take the tram on their own. They’ll have strong friendships. Alison and I will understand the healthcare system and know enough German to order a sandwich without having to point.</p>
<p>But it’s still September. We have to wait for the sun and moon to come and go 150 times.</p>
<p>I wish there were a magical way to fast-forward. Like in <em>The Matrix</em>, when Trinity calls back to the ship and says, &ldquo;I need a program for a V-212 helicopter… Hurry!&rdquo; Her eyelids flicker, and presto, she instantly knows how to fly the helicopter.</p>
<p>Or like in movies. Screenwriters never waste time on the learning part. Kung Fu Panda becomes a martial arts master in five minutes. It&rsquo;s the same with Marvel movies. Christian Bale (<em>Batman Begins</em>), Benedict Cumberbatch (<em>Doctor Strange</em>), Robert Downey Jr. (<em>Iron Man</em>), they all figure out their new superpowers faster than it takes me to grab a bucket of popcorn and Milk Duds.</p>
<p>Today at work, the cleaning lady (she&rsquo;s Croatian and doesn&rsquo;t speak German well) asked if we had dirty dishes. She said &ldquo;schmutzig&rdquo; (dirty), which is like the Yiddish word &ldquo;shmutz.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t sure what she meant, so I asked someone to interpret. One of my coworkers wrote it on a whiteboard [2]. Then someone else added the word for &ldquo;squirrel tail,&rdquo; a word I&rsquo;d heard before in a lunch conversation. It&rsquo;s a popular Austrian word used to test if someone speaks Austrian German. People from Munich don&rsquo;t even know what it means. I added a few more words I learned today, like &ldquo;train&rdquo; and &ldquo;railway&rdquo; from the train station, and &ldquo;wheat beer&rdquo; from a bar.</p>
<p>The final word on the whiteboard was a long one that loosely translates to &ldquo;anything animal.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s called a <em>Wunder Wuzzi</em> in Austrian German, though that doesn&rsquo;t actually mean &ldquo;anything&rdquo; or &ldquo;animal.&rdquo; A <em>Wunder Wuzzi</em> is an animal that does everything: it gives milk, grows wool, lays eggs, and tastes like bacon. The German word for this mythical beast is <em>Eierlegende Wollmilchsau</em> (&ldquo;egg-laying wool milk pig&rdquo;) [3]. Like &ldquo;squirrel tail,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s mostly useless vocabulary, except for a good laugh.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;everything animal&rdquo; even came up later in a slide presentation. It&rsquo;s a common saying here: there is no everything animal. In English, we&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no silver bullet.&rdquo; No easy solutions. No shortcuts. We have to go through the learning phase, the hard stuff.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Not to be a downer, but this is one of the things I dislike about superhero movies. The learning part is the most interesting to me, even if I sometimes feel too lazy to pursue it myself. I dislike plenty of other things about superhero movies, or should I say <em>movie</em>, since most are just variations of the same story.</p>
