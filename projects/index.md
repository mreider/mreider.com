A few open source projects I've built and maintain.

## Krems

Krems is a static site generator written in Go. It lets you publish Markdown websites to GitHub Pages more easily than Hugo or Jekyll.

mreider.com is built with Krems.

## Mattato

Mattato is a macOS menu bar Pomodoro timer that keeps track of your work sessions. It lives in your menu bar and lets you start 25-minute focused work periods with breaks in between.

It's built with Swift and designed to be lightweight and unobtrusive.
